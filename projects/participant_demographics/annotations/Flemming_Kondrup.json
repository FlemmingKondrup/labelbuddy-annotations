The study of the neural correlates of involuntary memories of stressful events in PTSD focuses on the voluntary retrieval of memories that are sometimes recalled as intrusive involuntary memories, not on involuntary retrieval while being scanned. Involuntary memory retrieval in controls has been shown to elicit activity in the parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, inferior parietal cortex, and posterior midline regions. However, it is unknown whether involuntary memories are supported by the same mechanisms in PTSD. Because previous work has shown that both behavioral and neural responsivity is slowed in PTSD, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of the neural activity underlying negative and neutral involuntary memory retrieval. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \nTwenty-one individuals with PTSD and 21 non-PTSD, trauma-exposed controls performed an involuntary memory task, while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. Environmental sounds served as cues for well-associated pictures of negative and neutral scenes. We used a finite impulse response model to analyze temporal differences between groups in neural responses. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nCompared with controls, participants with PTSD reported more involuntary memories, which were more emotional and more vivid, but which activated a similar network of regions. However, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed delayed neural responsivity in this network and increased vmPFC/ACC activity for negative > neutral stimuli. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe similarity between PTSD and controls in neural substrates underlying involuntary memories suggests that, unlike voluntary memories, involuntary memories elicit similar activity in regions critical for memory retrieval. Further, the delayed neural responsivity for involuntary memories in PTSD suggests that factors affecting cognition in PTSD, like increased fatigue, or avoidance behaviors could do so by delaying activity in regions necessary for cognitive processing. Finally, compared to neutral memories, negative involuntary memories elicit hyperactivity in the vmPFC, whereas the vmPFC is typically shown to be hypoactive in PTSD during voluntary memory retrieval. These patterns suggest that considering both the temporal dynamics of cognitive processes as well as involuntary cognitive processes would improve existing neurobiological models of PTSD. \n\n   Highlights  \n  \nWe conducted the first fMRI study of involuntary memory (IM) retrieval in PTSD. \n  \nActivity in IM regions was similar in PTSD and control groups but delayed in PTSD. \n  \nActivity in the vmPFC was higher in PTSD > controls for negative > neutral IMs. \n  \nPeople with PTSD had more IMs than controls. \n  \nModels of PTSD would benefit from studies of the timing of neural responsivity. \n  \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nInvoluntary episodic memories are explicit memories of past events that can be described by the rememberer, but are not preceded by a retrieval attempt ( ). Involuntary memories are assumed to be critical for maintaining a sense of continuity of self across time and for giving fast access to memories that may have functional relevance in novel situations ( ). They occur at least as frequently as their voluntary counterparts ( ;  ), and they are viewed as a basic mode of remembering, operating on the same system as voluntary memories ( ). \n\nInvoluntary memories of a traumatic event are a hallmark symptom of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD;  ), with intrusive memories being present in almost 90% of individuals with PTSD ( ). Past research indicates the frequency of these intrusive memories—and especially associated responses such as negative reinterpretations, a strong sense of reliving, and maladaptive emotional reactions to the memories—correlates highly with PTSD severity (e.g.,  ). Little is known about the neural underpinnings of the retrieval of involuntary memory. This paucity of research stands in marked contrast with the fact that in clinical disorders, such as PTSD, involuntary memories often become disruptive and distressing. Despite their centrality to the disorder, the basic cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying both emotional and non-emotional involuntary memories in PTSD are not well understood. \n\nWe were able to identify four studies that specifically addressed the neural basis of intrusive involuntary memories of stressful events. Two of these studies used a prospective design with healthy individuals to examine whether neural activity during the encoding of stressful stimuli would predict the reporting of involuntary intrusive memories of this material during a subsequent diary study. Both reported increased activity in limbic regions, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), striatum, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyrus, with such increased activity during the encoding of stressful films subsequently reported as flashbacks ( ), and during encoding in individuals reporting a high level of intrusions ( ). Neither of these studies examined neural activation during retrieval. \n\n had PTSD patients and controls provide a narrative account of their trauma or most distressing event before the scan. During the scan they conducted a recognition task in which they were asked to identify keywords culled from their own trauma narrative versus keywords derived from other participants' narratives. Outside the scanner, the participants subsequently identified which of the keywords had led to flashback experiences during the scan and which led to ordinary episodic memories.   found that flashbacks versus episodic recollections were associated with increased neural activity in the sensory and motor areas. However, since a voluntary autobiographical recognition task generated both types of memories, the neural activity did not target involuntary retrieval per se. \n\n examined involuntary retrieval of emotional film clips in healthy participants while they were at rest. The participants indicated that they had an involuntary memory from the film clip by pressing a button. In contrast to other work examining the neural underpinnings of involuntary memories in healthy individuals (e.g.,  ),   found that involuntary retrieval elicited activity in frontal regions. This finding may reflect that the memory recording necessarily involved a source monitoring judgment to decide whether a memory ‘popping into mind’ matched what had been seen in the film clip or not, since only involuntary memories related to the film clips should be reported. Thus, the frontal activity may be due to making this judgment, which might involve a voluntary search process and related cognitive control processes. We designed our task to address this issue by using retrospective report to determine when involuntary memories occur ( ). We also expand on this work by including individuals with PTSD and comparing negative to neutral involuntary memories. \n\nOutside the clinical literature, a few studies examined brain activity during involuntary memory retrieval.   compared voluntary and involuntary memories of scenes cued by environmental sounds to mimic the kinds of cues and memories that often occur during everyday life ( ;  ;  ). Both voluntary and involuntary memories elicited activity in regions typically found to be active during visual voluntary memory retrieval, including the parahippocampal gyrus, posterior midline regions like the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex, precuneus, and inferior parietal cortex (IPC). However, involuntary memory retrieval did not elicit activity in frontal cortices, likely reflecting the lack of effort involved in such retrieval ( ). \n\nTo our knowledge, no studies addressing the neural underpinnings of involuntary memories in PTSD have used a methodology that does not include the voluntary retrieval of a memory during the scan either to rate directly or to compare with a memory that has come involuntarily. The goal of the present study was to fill this gap in the literature. We wanted to examine the neural activations associated with involuntary memory processing in PTSD in general and not specifically for traumatic events. Developing a deeper understanding of such general processing deficits is relevant because, among other things, diagnostic inclusion criteria for PTSD include a general enhancement of negative affect that is not limited to trauma-relevant material. In particular, this includes difficulty experiencing positive affect, decreased interest in activities, and overly negative thoughts or assumptions about oneself or the world ( ). \n\nInvoluntary memories in PTSD compared to non-PTSD participants, irrespective of their trauma-relevance, involve greater emotionality and are more central to the life story ( ;  ,  ). Also, there is evidence of broad emotion regulation deficits in PTSD beyond traumatic material. Individuals with PTSD have abnormal responses to non-trauma-related negative stimuli, including increased self-reported emotion ( ;  ;  ) and enhanced neural activity to non-trauma-related stimuli ( ;  ;  ). Our focus on the broad emotion processing deficit in PTSD is consistent with an increasing emphasis in the PTSD literature on dysfunctional emotion regulation processes across a range of contexts, and not simply in response to the traumatic event per se (e.g.,  ;  ;  ;  ). Because of this aim we used the same paradigm as  , and developed in our previous work ( ;  ), but varied the emotionality of the scenes. \n\nVoluntary retrieval of scenes, such as those we used here, is commonly used in studies of involuntary memories in healthy individuals ( ;  ). They elicit activity in a well-characterized network of regions including the parahippocampal gyrus, the inferior and superior parietal cortices, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for reviews, see  ;  ). In previous work, we showed activity in a subset of these regions for involuntary memory retrieval ( ): the parahippocampal gyrus, thought to underlie successful retrieval, making contributions to scene and context memory ( ), the inferior parietal cortex, thought to be involved in bottom-up (i.e., non-goal-driven, or source-driven) attention to memory ( ;  ) and posterior midline regions like the posterior cingulate cortex, a key region in the default mode network, which has been associated with self-referential thought ( ;  ;  ;  ) and the precuneus, which has been associated with visual imagery ( ). There may be an additional anterior/posterior dissociation within the inferior parietal cortex, with anterior regions being involved in attention reorienting and posterior regions being associated with the default mode network ( ). Other regions not found to be active during involuntary memory retrieval ( ) are regions thought to be involved in top-down processes that are less likely to be invoked when retrieval is involuntary. The dorsolateral PFC is thought to be involved in memory search and maintenance ( ). The superior parietal cortex underlies top-down, goal-driven attention to memory ( ;  ). The differential and common activity in the superior and inferior parietal cortices, respectively, in voluntary and involuntary retrieval illustrates the dissociation in top-down versus bottom-up cognitive processes used during these two types of retrieval. These top-down processes allow for the maintenance of retrieval goals and may be more engaged during low-confidence memory retrieval in an attempt to retrieve additional details of a weak memory, whereas bottom-up processes are particularly engaged when the memory is salient ( ). Though these processes are thought to exist in two dimensions, they interact. Bottom-up processes can occur during voluntary memories and top-down processes can occur during involuntary memories. \n\nTo examine the neural activations associated with involuntary memory processing in PTSD generally, we did not intentionally select scenes that were trauma-relevant for each participant. Critically, participants did not indicate when they had an involuntary memory during the task because doing so would likely invoke top-down processes that would not typically occur during naturalistic involuntary remembering ( ) and would produce neural activity common to voluntary retrieval tasks. We also examined the specific time course for the neural activations, following up on previous work. Because retrieval in our task and in autobiographical memory can take seconds, we used fMRI to study the time course of retrieval, which allowed us to track the time course of neural processes ( ;  ). Investigating differences in the time course of neural processes is critical in PTSD because previous work indicates such differences in neural activity during memory retrieval ( ) and in response time during reflexive, involuntary processing in PTSD ( ;  ). Below, we present whole-brain results but with a theoretical focus on what we refer to as the involuntary memory network, derived from previous work on non-emotional involuntary memories, which includes the MTL, the precuneus, IPC, and posterior midline regions, as well as on emotion-processing regions consisting of the amygdala and the vmPFC. \n\n\n## Materials & methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nFifty-seven participants (35 women, mean age = 21.9 years, range = 18–37 years) completed the scan session. Participants gave written informed consent for a protocol approved by the Duke University Institutional Review Board and the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All participants had an A1 trauma in which they were exposed to death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence ( ). After excluding participants who did not meet inclusion criteria (see Supplemental materials) there were 21 participants in the PTSD group (15 women, mean age = 21.5 years, range = 18–31 years) and 21 in the trauma-exposed control group (14 women, mean age = 22.1 years, range = 18–37 years). Additional demographic and clinical data are shown in   and described in the Supplemental materials.   \nParticipant characteristics. \n  Table 1   \n\n\n### Materials \n  \nThe stimuli included 55 scenes and 95 environmental sounds (e.g., woman sneezing, lawn mower starting). We chose these stimuli because scene memories are typical of autobiographical memories and sounds are common cues for such memories ( ). We obtained the images from the International Affective Picture System ( ) and used normative IAPS valence ratings. We considered ratings from 1.0–3.5 to be negative, 3.6–5.5 to be neutral, and 5.6–9.0 to be positive. We only included negative and neutral scenes and did not choose images to be related to a specific trauma. The negative pictures depicted poverty, death/illness, violence, gore, filth, an accident, and hate groups. The neutral pictures depicted animals sometimes looked threatening, daily life activities, objects, and locations, military people and equipment, modes of transportation, locations, and portraits of people. While we did not intentionally choose scenes to be relevant to any individual participant's index trauma, some images may have been relevant to particular traumas. We did not obtain trauma-relevance ratings from the participants; however, a rater judged the trauma-relevance of each image for each trauma and found no more than nine images to be relevant to any participant's index trauma. \n\n\n### Experimental design and procedure \n  \nThe experimental design and procedure is nearly identical to that described in a previous publication in healthy subjects ( ). Here we report a short summary of the experimental design and procedures modified for the goals of the current study. For a full description, see the Supplemental materials and  .   \nBehavioral paradigm. (A) In session 1, during prescan encoding, participants heard a sound paired with a picture and were asked to type a sentence linking the sound and picture. (B) During another prescan encoding session, participants heard unpaired sounds and rated the uniqueness of the sound. (C) In session 2, participants performed a re-encoding session in the scanner, whereupon they were presented with previous stimuli and asked to rate on a 7-point scale how emotional the stimuli were. Participants were instructed that ‘stimuli’ referred to either the sound-picture pair for paired sounds or sounds alone for unpaired sounds. (D) Participants subsequently heard both paired and unpaired sounds and were asked to judge where the sound was located (left or right). (E) After the scan, all participants heard all sounds and were asked questions about their experiences in the scanner (see text for post-scan questions details). \n  Fig. 1   \n\nTwo days before MRI scanning, participants encoded the 55 paired and 40 unpaired sounds. To ensure strong memory associations, there were four encoding runs, during which participants were presented with the sound-picture pairs and wrote a sentence or a short story linking the sound and the picture. Two days after encoding, they participated in an fMRI session during which they re-encoded the paired and unpaired sounds and then completed the critical sound localization/memory recall runs. During the re-encoding runs, each sound-picture pair and unpaired sound was presented. Participants rated on a 7-point scale how emotional the stimuli were. During the recall runs, the 55 paired and 40 unpaired sounds (randomly intermixed) were presented, panned 15° to either the left or the right using specialized audio software (Audacity,  ). Participants indicated the side on which the sound was louder. We presented each sound for 4 s, followed by a 1.5-second response period, during which the screen was blank and participants completed the sound localization judgment. A fixation period followed (jittered with a mean of 4 s, range: 1.5 s–10.4 s). At the beginning of the run, we instructed participants to wait until after the sound had ended to respond. Immediately following the scanning session, participants completed a post-scan questionnaire to assess their memory for the scenes. Participants heard all 95 sounds. After the presentation of each sound, participants reported: (1) whether they had remembered a picture when the sound was played during the sound localization task (yes/no), (2) how hard they tried to perform the sound localization task correctly (1 = did not try at all, 7 = tried very hard), (3) how hard they tried to recall a picture during the scan (1 = did not try at all, 7 = tried very hard), and (4) how vivid the memory of the picture was during the scan (1 = not at all vivid, 7 = very vivid). Lastly, we presented the 55 paired sounds a final time and participants provided a description of the picture originally paired with the sound. Two independent judges rated these descriptions for accuracy. In the case of disagreement, a third judge broke the tie. As described below, only paired sounds that elicited a memory without effort and unpaired sounds that did not elicit a memory and had no retrieval effort were analyzed. \n\n\n### Image acquisition and preprocessing \n  \nImaging was conducted on a 3 T GE Signa Excite MRI scanner (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI) with an eight-channel head coil. Following a localizer scan was a T1-weighted structural image, (96 contiguous slices acquired with a high-resolution, 3D fast inverse recovery-prepared spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) sequence, with a repetition time (TR) = 3.22 ms, echo time (TE) = 8.2 ms, inversion recovery time (TI) = 450 ms, 1 mm slice thickness, and parallel imaging with a selection factor of 2). During the task, T2*- weighted echo-planar, functional images were acquired using a spiral-in sequence with SENSE imaging (34 contiguous slices, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, FOV = 240 mm, 3.8 mm slice thickness with no gaps, flip angle = 70°, voxel size = 3.75 × 3.75 × 3.8 mm, 64 × 64 matrix, SENSE factor = 2). Preprocessing and analyses of functional imaging data were conducted with Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM12; Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), along with locally developed Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) scripts. We discarded the first three volumes of each run, including the first trial of each run, for scanner stability. We also excluded the discarded trials for each run from behavioral analyses. Images were corrected for slice-timing and head motion, spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute template using a 12-parameter affine model, and then spatially smoothed with an 8-mm Gaussian kernel. A high-pass filter was included in every model to correct for scanner drift. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nWe created two general linear models: a Memory model comparing paired and unpaired sound trials and an Emotion model comparing high and low emotional valence trials. In the Memory model, the first-level model included regressors for paired sound trials in which there was a reported memory and a low effort rating (1 or 2 out of 7), and unpaired sound trials for which there was no reported memory and a low effort rating. We split these trials according to sound lateralization (paired left, paired right, unpaired left, and unpaired right) to account for this additional variance. We collapsed the sound lateralization factor at the second level. In both models, we included all high-effort trials, paired sound trials that did not elicit a memory, and unpaired sound trials that did elicit a memory as trials of no interest, as well as regressors accounting for motion and run-level effects. \n\nIn the Emotion model, at the first level, we separately included regressors for high and low emotion paired sounds (both with low-effort and that elicited a memory). We only used paired sounds in this model because unpaired sounds did not have a paired picture from which IAPS ratings could be used to classify it as high or low emotion. Therefore, we included unpaired sounds as trials of no interest. \n\nWe initially identified activations using a finite impulse response (FIR) model ( ;  ), which we preferred over a standard canonical hemodynamic response model to better understand the temporal dynamics of involuntary memory retrieval. We initially modeled seven TRs, or 14 s, starting at the beginning of the trial, not adjusted for the hemodynamic lag, but included only the 3rd to 6th TRs in analyses. The 1st and 2nd TRs were not analyzed to account for the hemodynamic lag ( ) as activity occurring before this could not reliably be attributed to the presentation of the sound at the beginning of each trial. The 7th TR was not analyzed because it corresponded to the beginning of the subsequent trial. The 3rd and 4th TRs corresponded to the time period during which peak activity associated with the sound would be expected to occur, accounting for hemodynamic lag. The 5th and the 6th TRs corresponded to the time period during which involuntary memories could continue to be formed. \n\nAdditionally, exploratory analyses revealed that activity was similar in the 3rd and 4th TRs and in the 5th and the 6th TRs. Therefore, to maintain a consistent length of time represented by each time point we collapsed these pairs of TRs to create an   early and a late time point  . The late time point included the 1.5 s response period and 2.5 s of the jitter. The late time point was not contaminated by the cognitive processes involved in the subsequent trial because the hemodynamic response for the subsequent trial does not peak until approximately 6 s after that trial begins. We report whole-brain results at a significance threshold of   p   < 0.05 using a false discovery rate (FDR) correction and a cluster correction of   p   < 0.05, using a family-wise error (FWE) correction. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n#### Memory model: paired > unpaired \n  \nWe report behavioral results for paired > unpaired sounds in  . PTSD participants reported more involuntary memories (those retrieved with low effort) than controls, and paired sounds elicited more involuntary memories than unpaired sounds. Additionally, focusing only on trials included in the fMRI analyses (paired sounds that elicited a memory and unpaired sounds that did not), an ANOVA revealed higher emotion ratings (gathered during encoding) and vividness (gathered during the post-scan retrieval run) for paired sounds relative to unpaired sounds (see  ).   \nMemory model behavioral results. Note, the number of trials modeled, shown in parantheses in the % recalled column, were not included in tests of behavioral differences. \n  Table 2       \n\n\n#### Emotion model: high > low emotion \n  \nWe report behavioral analyses for high > low emotion sound-picture pairs in  . Notably, the PTSD group had more involuntary memories to both high and low emotion trials than controls. There was no effect of emotion on the number of memories recalled.   \nEmotion model behavioral results. Note, the number of trials modeled, shown in parantheses in the % Recalled column, were not included in tests of behavioral differences. \n  Table 3       \n\nThere were no reaction time differences for either model. Behavioral performance on the localization task for both models is reported in the Supplemental materials. \n\n\n#### Post-scan recall \n  \nWe quantified the number of pictures that were accurately recalled voluntarily after the scan. Technical error resulted in missing data for one PTSD participant. There was an effect of Group (F(1, 82) = 5.80,   p   < 0.05), with the PTSD group accurately recalling a greater percentage of the pictures (PTSD mean: 0.92, control mean: 0.85), an effect of Emotion (F(1, 82) = 4.03,   p   < 0.05), with a greater percentage of low emotion pictures being accurately recalled (low emotion mean: 0.92, high emotion mean: 0.86), but no Group x Emotion interaction (F(1, 82) = 0.06,   p >   0.05). \n\n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \nBecause we could not be certain when the involuntary memories would occur, we probed neural activity at two time points: an early time point including the 4 s when the sound played, and a late time point including the 4 s after the sound stopped. We first discuss the results of a Memory model in which the neural underpinnings of involuntary memories can be probed in both groups. The Memory model is a 2 (Group) × 2 (Time) model. Then we discuss an Emotion model in which we contrast high and low emotion trials. Since all results shown are for the negative > neutral trials, this model is also a 2 (Group) × 2 (Time) design. \n\n#### Memory model: paired sounds > unpaired sounds \n  \n##### Group × time interaction \n  \nResults from the Group × Time interaction revealed timing differences in a similar set of regions for controls (early > late) and PTSD (late > early): bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, IPC, and PCC exhibited delayed activity in the PTSD group compared to the control group ( ,  ). There was no activity for the reverse contrast (control late > early, PTSD early > late).   \nMemory model. Group (PTSD, Control) × Time (Early, Late) interaction. All activity is significant at   p   < 0.05, FDR-corrected, cluster corrected to   p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected. A. Regions of interest are highlighted. B. Time courses plotting paired > unpaired differences at each TR for regions of interest shown above. Each TR is 2 s. The first, second, and seventh TRs were not included in any analyses and are included for illustrative purposes only. Activity relating to the early and late time points is indicated with light and dark gray boxes over the respective time points. These graphs indicate that the paired > unpaired sound difference is greater for the control group than the PTSD group during the early time point but that this difference is greater for the PTSD group than the control group in the late time point. C. Time courses for paired and unpaired sounds are plotted separately. The data are available on neurovault:  . \n  Fig. 2     \nMemory model. Top peaks from the Group × Time interaction. All results are significant at   p   < 0.05, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons, cluster corrected at   p   < 0.05, FWE-corrected. Note: peaks from the ROIs were not among the top peaks in this table but are shown in  . \n  Table 4   \n\n###### Group × time interaction follow-up analyses \n  \nTo further explore the change in neural activity between the early and the late time points in the control and PTSD groups, we test the observation that our results may be due to a difference between groups at one time window but not the other. We first calculated the average BOLD signal estimates for each time point for each of the six regions shown in  . We then subtracted the early and late BOLD signal estimates to determine the change in activity between the early minus the late time points in the control group and the late minus the early time points in the PTSD group. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the change in activity between time points. The closer the ratio is to one, the more similar the change in activity between time points. The average ratio across all six regions is 0.659, suggesting that the change in activity between the early and late time points was similar across groups. See Table S1 for more details. \n\nAdditionally, we examined the paired > unpaired sound contrast (i.e. sounds that elicited a memory > sounds that did not elicit a memory) during the early time point for the control group combined with the late time point for the PTSD group. This analysis revealed whether activity at the early time point for the control group and the late time point for the PTSD group was greater than zero. There was significant activity in posterior midline regions and inferior parietal cortex. When the threshold was raised slightly to   p   < 0.055, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons, our a priori hypothesized region, the parahippocampal gyrus, was also active (see Fig. S1 and Table S2). There was no activity for the control group late combined with the PTSD group early. This supports our claim that involuntary memories elicit activity in a similar network of regions at different times for the two groups. \n\n\n\n##### Main effect of group \n  \nThere was no significant main effect of group, suggesting that the regions associated with memory retrieval are similar between groups. To test for similarities within the memory network between groups, we conducted two additional analyses. First, we extracted estimates of activity in these regions for both groups in both time points and ran   t-  tests to compare the groups. We compared control early to PTSD late and compared PTSD early to control late since the Group x Time analysis suggested that the memory network was similar between groups but peaked at different times. There were no differences in activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group in any region and the absolute value of the   t-scores   was lower than one for five out of the six regions of interest. Turning to differences between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group, there were no differences in activity and   t-scores   were lower than 1.2 for the all regions (see  ). This suggests that memory network activity is similar between groups but with different peak times.   \nA between-group, between-time point comparison of activity associated with involuntary memory retrieval. The regions are shown in  . There is similar activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group in all regions. There is also similar activity between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group in all regions. This suggests that a similar neural network underlies involuntary memory retrieval in PTSD and controls with the difference being the time that it peaks. \n  Table 5     \n\nSecond, we lowered the threshold for the test of the Main Effects of Group to determine whether there were differences between groups at a slightly more lenient threshold. There was no activity for control > PTSD at a threshold as high as   p   < 0.45, FDR corrected for multiple comparisons. Even raising the threshold as high as   p   < 0.65 only revealed a 16-voxel cluster in the postcentral gyrus. There was no activity for PTSD > control at a threshold as high as   p   < 0.95. The lack of activity in regions thought to be involved in memory retrieval even at these extremely lenient thresholds supports our claim that activity in these regions is similar between groups but with peaks at different times. \n\n\n##### Main effect of time \n  \nThere was no significant main effect of time. \n\n\n\n#### Emotion model: high versus low emotion \n  \nHaving established that high and low emotion involuntary memories elicit activity in regions that we predicted, but at different times for the control and PTSD groups, we turn to examining the differences between high and low emotion involuntary memories. \n\n##### Comparing high > low emotion involuntary memories across group and time: group × time interaction \n  \nThere was no significant Group × Time interaction. \n\n\n##### Comparing high > low emotion involuntary memories across group and time: main effect of group \n  \nAcross both time points, the PTSD group exhibited greater activity in vmPFC and ACC.

First, a similar network of regions is active during involuntary memory retrieval for PTSD and controls. Second, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed delayed neural responsivity in regions typically associated with memory retrieval ( ;  ) and previously shown to be associated with involuntary memory retrieval in healthy adults ( ). Third, compared to controls, individuals with PTSD showed increased vmPFC/ACC activity for high > low emotion stimuli. \n\n### Finding 1: similarities in the memory network between PTSD and controls \n  \nInvoluntary memories elicited similar activity between controls and PTSD in regions involved in the memory network, including the MTL, precuneus, PCC, and IPC. This is in contrast with neurobiological models of PTSD based on voluntary memory retrieval that emphasize dysfunctional activity in the medial temporal lobes and related memory circuits ( ;  ;  ;  ). Also, in contrast with the voluntary memory literature, we show that the PTSD group had more involuntary memories than the control group. This is consistent with work showing a positive correlation between the frequency of involuntary memories and PTSD symptoms ( ) whereas voluntary memory retrieval, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is impaired in PTSD ( ) and may even be a risk factor for PTSD ( ). One reason for these deficits could be that individuals with PTSD have decreased executive control functioning ( ;  ; for reviews, see  ;  ). Since involuntary memory retrieval requires little, if any, executive control, unlike voluntary memory retrieval, these results suggest that memory network integrity and behavioral performance may partially depend on whether retrieval requires cognitive control. \n\n\n### Finding 2: delayed activity in the memory network in PTSD \n  \nAnalyses indicated a lag in activity in the memory network in PTSD compared with controls. This timing effect is extremely strong, with over 70,000 voxels in 15 peaks showing earlier activity in the control group compared to no significant activity peaking earlier in the PTSD group. This effect has negligible odds of occurring by chance. Moreover, the activity includes locations we predicted would be active during involuntary memory retrieval based on the existing literature. These findings align with both behavioral work showing delayed response times in PTSD during voluntary memory retrieval ( ) and neuroimaging work showing slow neural responsivity in PTSD in similar regions during voluntary memory retrieval ( ). Our results indicate that this processing delay is not limited to effortful retrieval. \n\nThe time of peak activity in the control group is consistent with other work showing that neural activity in response to involuntary recall in healthy individuals peaks up to 6 s after the memory ( ). However, other work comparing the retrieval of memories that had previously been recalled as flashbacks in PTSD showed that compared with control participants, PTSD showed decreased posterior midline and parahippocampal activity ( ). Though at first glance this appears to be inconsistent with our results, it highlights the necessity of investigating the difference in the timing of the neural response to such memories. In the current study, when activity was compared between groups in the early time point, there appeared to be hypoactivity in the controls and hyperactivity in the PTSD group in similar regions. It was not until later activity was examined that activity in these regions was revealed in the PTSD group. This suggests that hypoactivity found in   and other studies ( ;  ;  ;  ) could be reexamined in light of these results. \n\nWe offer four possible explanations for this delayed activity in the memory network in PTSD. The first explanation is that involuntary memories take longer to construct in PTSD. The involuntary memories measured here were more vivid in PTSD than controls. This finding is consistent with other work showing highly vivid intrusive memories in PTSD ( ;  ) that decrease in vividness after therapy ( ). Memories become more specific and likely more vivid as more time passes to construct the memory ( ;  ). It is possible that more time is needed to construct highly vivid memories in PTSD. A second possible explanation is that the slowed processing speed is driven by factors that affect both effortful and non-effortful cognitive processes. Not only do PTSD patients have slowed reaction times to tasks that require cognitive control ( ;  ; for a review, see  ) but they have slower reaction times during reflexive attention tasks ( ;  ), which may reflect a generalized cognitive slowing. This could be caused by increased fatigue or decreased cognitive capacity. PTSD participants in our study did not have slowed reaction times to the localization task. This is likely because participants were given 4 s to respond and speeded responding was not emphasized in the instructions. Other work has shown that when speed is not emphasized, reaction time is not slowed in PTSD (e.g.  ;  ). Third, this processing delay is the result of increased cognitive demand caused by coping with internal psychological distress or monitoring the environment for threats ( ). Fourth is that people with PTSD try to avoid having memories. Using the think/no-think paradigm ( ) activity during memory retrieval can be modulated by instructing participants to not think of a memory ( ;  ). One of the required symptoms of PTSD is avoidance ( ), which involves trying to avoid having emotional memories or to suppress the emotional response. People with PTSD avoid thinking about their trauma ( ;  ) and avoid emotionally processing memories ( ). In contrast, people without PTSD are less likely to suppress or distract themselves after an involuntary memory ( ). However, suppression is generally unsuccessful in PTSD ( ), so it is possible that the attempt at suppression only delays the onset of the memory. Future work controlling for these factors and investigating different types of involuntary memories, like trauma-specific memories, will shed light on this issue. \n\n\n### Finding 3: hyperactivity in vmPFC/ACC \n  \nThere was also increased vmPFC/ACC activity in PTSD compared to controls for high versus low emotion involuntary memories. Fear regulation models have posited that the vmPFC/ACC modulates fear extinction and emotion regulation by downregulating activity in the amygdala ( ;  ); the vmPFC/ACC may be involved in regulating other emotions as well ( ;  ). In PTSD, the vmPFC/ACC is typically hypoactive, putatively leading to a hyperresponsive amygdala ( ). This has also been shown in voluntary recall of traumatic events and emotional scenes ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ) but it is not clear whether this hypoactivity could be expected to generalize to involuntary memories. While there is no previous work on the neural basis of involuntary memories in PTSD to inform this question, involuntary memories do share traits with studied phenomena, like responses to unexpected stimuli. Models discussing this vmPFC/ACC hypoactivity are based on task paradigms in which the emotional items are the focal point ( ;  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  ;  ,  ,  ;  ), and are thus expected. However, investigating responses to unexpected stimuli is critical because many key symptoms revolve around such responses ( ). In fact, unexpected stimuli appear to elicit different neural responses than do expected stimuli. For example, stimuli presented quickly, below the threshold of conscious detection, elicit heightened vmPFC/ACC activity in PTSD compared to controls ( ,  ,  ), as do emotional stimuli presented as distractors ( ;  ;  ;  , but see  ). Our results suggest that the unexpected nature of involuntary memories may elicit hyperactivity not predicted by prevailing PTSD models. Hyperactivity in these contexts may reflect the generation of nonconscious fear signals that reorient attention to threatening stimuli ( ;  ). \n\nConsistent with the idea that vmPFC/ACC hypoactivity is not a canonical PTSD correlate, as implied by prevailing PTSD models, is a lesion study showing that vmPFC lesions decrease the likelihood of developing PTSD ( ). If vmPFC/ACC hypoactivity results in increased amygdala activity, then a lesion here should cause increased emotional responsivity and increased PTSD symptomology. The role of the vmPFC is multifaceted. It has been shown to be involved in self-referential thought ( ;  ), and the retrieval of contextual details and initiating subsequent action based on those details ( ;  ). Understanding the circumstances under which there is hypo- versus hyperactivity here and integrating what is known about the role of this region in other cognitive processes is vital to understanding emotion dysfunction in PTSD. \n\nIt can also be noted that the control group had greater activity in the vmPFC/ACC for the neutral stimuli than the negative. It is possible that this relates to attention reorienting ( ) or safety signaling ( ) in controls but not PTSD, but these speculative ideas warrant direct investigation in future work. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nThis study has several limitations. First, we used the post-scan self-report of memory retrieval and effort to classify trials as successful, low effort memory trials or not. We classified trials as successful based on participants' self-report of memory retrieval and effort. Though the use of self-report to classify trials may lead to the misclassification of some trials, there is both behavioral and neural evidence that this paradigm does elicit involuntary memories with high frequency. When unique cues are used to cue memories of unique scenes, similar to the cues and scenes used in this paradigm, and participants report the retrieval of involuntary memories as they occur in real time, almost 60% of the cues elicit involuntary memories ( ). This rate is similar to the frequency with which involuntary memories are elicited in our control group, shown above. Additionally, involuntary memories occur more frequently in PTSD than in controls ( ), similar to the pattern that we find. Finally, the similarity in neural activity for voluntary and involuntary memory retrieval ( ) suggests that the use of post-hoc self-report to classify trials is reasonably accurate. \n\nSecond, our claim that there is similar activity between groups in regions critical for memory retrieval, but at different times, is derived from the Group x Time interaction effect in the Memory Model, and the lack of a Main Effect of Group. To ensure that the similar activity did not rely solely on a null result, we conducted four additional analyses to make four additional claims. In the first analysis, we focused on the six key regions of interest for memory retrieval. We conducted   t-tests   comparing activity between the early time point in the control group and the late time point in the PTSD group, as well as between the late time point in the control group and the early time point in the PTSD group. The t-scores were all smaller than 1.5 and for 9 of the 12 they were smaller than one. In the second analysis, we showed that there was no Main Effect of Group even at extremely lenient thresholds. In the third analysis, we showed that there was significant activity in these critical memory regions for the control group early and the PTSD group late, and that there was no activity for the control group late and the PTSD group early. This shows that activity in these regions was not driven solely by the difference between the early and late time points, but that the activity in both groups is significantly greater than zero. In the fourth analysis, we compared the change in activity between the early and late time points in the six regions of interest between groups and showed that it was similar between groups for most regions. Together, this set of supplemental analyses lend significant support to our claim that the activity in this involuntary memory network is similar between groups but that it peaks at different times between groups. \n\nThird, encoding processes are sometimes disrupted in PTSD ( ), suggesting that the neural differences we find may be due to differences in encoding. However, impaired encoding should result in impaired voluntary retrieval. The voluntary post-scan recall scores were similar between groups, suggesting that in our paradigm, encoding was preserved in PTSD. This could be due to having several encoding sessions. \n\nFourth, we did not directly measure the relatedness of the stimuli to our participants' trauma. However, using trauma descriptions, we determined the relatedness of each picture to each individual's trauma and found that very few pictures were trauma-relevant for anyone. Therefore, we do not think this issue will have a large impact on results. Again, it should be underscored that the aim of the study was to examine the neural underpinning of involuntary memory processing generally in PTSD, and not specifically in relation to personally traumatic material as this overgeneralization to less traumatic situations is what produces many of the symptoms and dysfunctions of the disorder. However, since the present study was not designed to examine neural activity underlying trauma-related involuntary memories in PTSD, it is therefore not clear whether the findings of delayed activity in the memory network in PTSD will generalize to involuntary, intrusive memories of real-life traumatic events. This is an important question for future research to address. \n\nFifth, we used a relatively high-functioning population; all participants were students or were in the work force. It is possible that people with more debilitating PTSD symptoms could have different neural responses to involuntary memories. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n  \nUnderstanding the neural mechanisms underlying emotional involuntary memories can pave the way toward the development of a treatment that could alleviate this key symptom of PTSD and can also add to the understanding of the basic emotional processing deficits seen in PTSD. The importance of involuntary memories to PTSD is widely recognized with work seeking to understand the mechanisms underlying the encoding of such memories ( ,  ). However, the current study fills a gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying their retrieval. We show that existing models of PTSD do not predict spatiotemporal neural patterning of involuntary memories particularly well. Given that many of the symptoms of PTSD revolve around responses to the unexpected (involuntary memories, startle responses, hypervigilance toward unknown threats), our innovative approach opens up additional lines of inquiry that could be key to understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying these symptoms. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"a133ab7fff31b5e319bab6ea8ad4d610"},

A few recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies indicate that the RS-fMRI could map off-line memory consolidation effects. However, the gene effects on memory consolidation process remain largely unknown. Here we collected two RS-fMRI sessions, one before and another after an episodic memory encoding task, from two groups of healthy young adults, one with apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2/ε3 and the other with APOE ε3/ε4. The ratio of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local synchronization of spontaneous RS-fMRI signal, of the two sessions was used as an index of memory-consolidation. APOE ε3/ε4 group showed greater ReHo ratio within the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The ReHo ratio in MTL was significantly correlated with the recognition memory performance in the APOE ε3/ε4 group but not in ε2/ε3 group. Additionally, APOE ε3/ε4 group showed lower ReHo ratio in the occipital and parietal picture-encoding areas. Our results indicate that APOE ε3/ε4 group may have a different off-line memory consolidation process compared to ε2/ε3 group. These results may help generate future hypotheses that the off-line memory consolidation might be impaired in Alzheimer’s disease. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nMüller and Pilzecker assumed that new memory takes time to be consolidated after encoding  . Many studies have shown that spontaneous brain activity after memory encoding is associated with memory consolidation. Single-unit recording animal study suggested that the spontaneous activity of the hippocampal place cells after learning is associated with memory consolidation  . With fairly good spatial and temporal resolution, RS-fMRI provides unique non-invasive technique to investigate the spontaneous activity of the human brain. Recent RS-fMRI studies have indicated an association of spontaneous brain activity with memory consolidation of recent scenarios  – . These results support the system consolidation theory, which hypothesized that the MTL (mainly hippocampus and parahippocampus) is required for initial storage and recall and that the neo-cortex is considered as the area where remote memory is stored  ,  . Recent memory consolidation studies also suggest that the MTL may play multiple roles in memory consolidation  . However, the changed relationship or functional connectivity between remote brain areas by these RS-fMRI studies did not reveal whether the local spontaneous activity in a specific area (e.g., MTL or neo-cortex) was modulated by a preceding task. Only two studies have measured the assciation between local activity and memory consolidation in human. One study used perfusion MRI and found that the regional cerebral blood flow increased in hippocampal and temporal lobe regions after a learning task and that the increases correlated with the performance of surprised recall task  . Another very recent study from our group found that the local synchronization of spontaneous fMRI signal in the MTL increased after an episodic memory task in a group of participants having better performance in a later surprise retrieval task, but not in a group having worse performance  . \n\nThe presence of APOE ε4 allele is related to increased risk of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  ,  . Subtle episodic memory deficits are the earliest cognitive symptom of AD  . Structural MRI studies have reported significant atrophy of the MTL in AD patients  ,  . Functional MRI studies consistently showed abnormal MTL activation in patients with AD   and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)  . Altered brain activations were also reported even in healthy carriers of APOE ε4 during memory encoding stage in the hippocampus  ,  . All these studies provided strong evidences that the MTL in AD or APOE ε4 carriers is associated with episodic memory deficit. Thus our first hypothesis was that the APOE ε4 healthy carriers probably have a different memory consolidation process in the MTL as compared with ε4 non-carriers. \n\nTwo previous RS-fMRI studies found memory consolidation-related changes in functional connectivity between brain areas associated with stimulus encoding. Albert et al.   showed that a resting state fronto-parietal network that is believed to be involved in visuomotor processing was modulated by motor learning, but not motor performance. Tambini et al.   showed that after a task with higher associative memory performance rather than poor memory performance, the magnitude of resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampal and lateral occipital complex was altered. The results from animal and human studies support the system consolidation theory, which hypothesized that the MTL is required for initial storage and recall and that the neo-cortex is considered as the area where remote memory is stored  ,  . Therefore, our second hypothesis was that the changes of local spontaneous activity related to off-line memory consolidation in the areas where picture encoding occurs might be different between APOE ε4 healthy carriers and non-carriers. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \nThere were two sub-studies. The whole study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University. The first sub-study was an APOE genotype screening study. 1220 students at Beijing Normal University were enrolled by advertisement when they were taking a freshmen entrance physical examination. After they gave a written informed consent, 4 ml extra blood was obtained when they were undergoing blood sampling during the physical examination. They were told that DNA genotyping results would not be sent to them. \n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes using salting out method  . 917 of the 1220 samples were genotyped for the APOE allele type using PCR-RFLP  . Six APOE genotypes were identified: ε2/ε2 (N = 1), ε2/ε3 (N = 52), ε2/ε4 (N = 13), ε3/ε3 (N = 799), ε3/ε4 (N = 51) and ε4/ε4 (N = 1). \n\nIt has been reported that APOE ε2 may exert protective effects  . It is therefore expected that effects of the ε2/ε3 vs. ε3/ε4 may be larger than those of ε3/ε3 vs. ε3/ε4. About one year later, 40 healthy Han Chinese students (aged 18 - 23 years of age), 20 for ε2/ε3 group and 20 for ε3/ε4 group, were chosen from the above sample while the sex was matched between the two groups. The number of participants were kept similar from each college of Beijing Normal University. All participants were right-handed and without a family history of AD by self report. None of the participants had current or past history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. All participants gave written informed consent for MRI scanning and they did not know their genotypes. 35 participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised for China (WAIS-RC). After the MRI scanning, they were all paid for their participation. One ε2/ε3 participant was excluded because of abnormal brain structure. \n\n\n### Scanning Procedure \n  \nMRI data was acquired on a SIEMENS TRIO 3.0 Tesla scanner in Beijing Normal University. There were five scanning sessions: \n  \nThe first RS-fMRI session (REST-1): 8 min (240 volumes). Participants were instructed to keep awake, close their eyes, and think of nothing in particular. Functional T2* blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) images were obtained using an echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 33 contiguous axial slices (thickness/gap = 3/0.6 mm, repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, matrix = 64×64, and a field of view (FOV) = 200×200 mm ). \n  \nMemory encoding task fMRI: 5 min (151 volumes). Participants were asked to press a button in their left or right hands by their index fingers to indicate that a picture was indoor or outdoor. Each picture appeared on center of the screen for 1500 ms. Participants were asked to make a decision in 2000 ms. The time between the end of a picture and the beginning of next picture was 500–6500 ms (average 3500 ms). In total 60 pictures (30 indoor and 30 outdoor) were presented in a pseudo-random order via E-prime software. To improve accuracy and the familiarity to the procedure, a short practice (10 different indoor/outdoor pictures) immediately before this task session was performed. Scanning parameters were the same as REST-1. \n  \nStructure MRI: approximately 10 min. We acquired T1-weighted sagittal three-dimensional images using magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (128 slices, TR = 2530 ms, TE = 3.39 ms, slice thickness  = 1.33 mm, flip angle = 7°, inversion time = 1100 ms, FOV = 256×256 mm  and in-plane resolution = 256×192). \n  \nThe second RS-fMRI session (REST-2): 8 min (240 volumes). Instructions and scanning parameters of this session were the same as REST-1. \n  \nMemory retrieval task fMRI: two runs, each lasting 5 min (151 volumes). Immediately before this task, the participants were told there would be a test task. The instructions were presented on the screen and read by the experimenter. When a picture was presented, the participants had to press the button in their right hands if they had ever seen the picture during the encoding stage; otherwise, they had to press the button in their left hands. In total 120 pictures, 60 old and 60 new, and 30 indoor and 30 outdoor were presented. The reaction time (RT) was recorded. The scanning parameters and picture presentation times were the same as REST-1. In this session, only behavior data was analyzed. \n  \nParticipants were not told that there would be a retrieval task until immediately before this retrieval task. Accordingly, the possibility of intentional memory performance was minimized during the two RS-fMRI sessions. \n\n\n### Pictures for Task Presentation \n  \nEncoding and retrieval sessions included totally 120 color pictures, half depicting indoor scenes and the other half depicting outdoor scenes. In order to make the error rate varies fairly large across participants (i.e., not too easy or hard to remember), we selected 120 pictures from a set of 180 pictures using a pilot behavioral experiment. Of these 180 pictures, 69 were neutral pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS)   and the rest were obtained from the internet. \n\nAll these pictures could be easily classified into indoor or outdoor. All pictures were formatted in 640×480 pixels and were presented via E-prime software. We recruited an additional 12 college students to perform the pilot behavioral experiment. This pilot behavioral experiment had an encoding stage and a retrieval stage with a resting interval of approximately 20 minutes. The instructions and task presentation of the pilot experiment were the same as the fMRI task. The participants were not told it was a memory task before the retrieval stage. After the indoor or outdoor judgment task, they were just told to take a break to wait for another behavioral experiment. These participants were divided into 3 groups, each group (4 participants) encoding 60 images (30 indoor and 30 outdoor). The retrieval stage was the same as that of fMRI task, i.e., 60 old pictures and 60 new pictures. For each of the 180 old pictures, there were 4 participants. Therefore the hit number would be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 for each picture. For pictures with a hit score of 0 or 4 (i.e., no or all participants could remember correctly), only a small part of these pictures was chosen as the fMRI task pictures. But for pictures with a hit score of 1, 2, or 3, large part of these pictures was chosen. Finally, 120 pictures were selected for the fMRI study. The above procedure for picture collection was the same one as in our previous paper published very recently  . \n\n\n### Behavior Data Analysis \n  \nD-prime is a statistic used in signal detection theory and calculated as: d-prime = Z (hit rate) - Z (false alarm rate)  . Z is the standard Z score (minus mean and then divided by the standard deviation). A higher d-prime means a larger difference between the hit rate and correct rejection, i.e., a better recognition memory performance here. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Preprocessing \n  \nThe first 10 time points were discarded to remove the initial transient effects and to allow participant get used to the scanner noise. Then RS-fMRI data were processed using SPM8 ( ) and DPARSF   ( ), including slice timing, realignment and normalization. All functional images were normalized into Montreal Neurology Institute (MNI) space in three stages. First, the functional images of each participant were co-registered with their own high-resolution structural T1 image. Second, the spatial normalization parameters of T1 image were estimated by segmentation. Lastly, the parameters were applied to the functional images. Then REsting-State fMRI data analysis Toolkit   was used for removing the linear trend and temporal filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) of the time courses. \n\n\n### Region of Interest (ROI) Definition \n  \nROIs were defined by AAL template  . The medial temporal lobe (MTL) ROI includes bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal region ( ). The encoding-related ROIs were defined by the activation map of encoding pictures (  p  <0.05, cluster size >270 mm ). \n   The medial temporal lobe (MTL) ROI.  \nThe MTL ROI from AAL, including the bilateral hippocampus and parahippocampal regions. \n  \n\n### RS-fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nWe used ReHo   to measure the local synchronization of spontaneous brain activities, which was estimated for each participant by computing Kendall’s coefficient of concordance (KCC) of the time series of 27 nearest neighboring voxels. Compared with functional connectivity, ReHo requires no a priori definition of ROIs, and can provide local synchronization of spontaneous activity. ReHo has been used in AD and MCI researches  ,  , and ReHo has been found to be correlated with some behavior performance, such as stop signal reaction time  . REST software   was used to build individual ReHo maps. To quantify changes of the memory consolidation-related spontaneous brain activity, we used the ReHo ratio below: \n\nFor each participant, ReHo of REST-2 was divided by ReHo of REST-1 in a voxel-wise manner to get the map of ReHo ratio. And then ReHo ratio maps were smoothed using a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. ReHo ratio between the two APOE groups were compared using the two-sample T-tests voxel by voxel in each ROI. AlphaSim, a program based on Monte Carlo simulation and implemented in AFNI ( ) was used for multiple comparison correction within each ROI (i.e., small volume correction, SVC). AlphaSim has been implemented in REST software  . The corrected   p  <0.05 corresponds to a combination of uncorrected   p  <0.05 and cluster size >567 mm  in the MTL ROI and a combination of   p  <0.05 and cluster size >1566 mm  in the encoding ROI. Finally, correlation analysis between ReHo ratio and recognition memory performance was performed in each group. \n\nTo remove potential effects of encoding activation on the memory consolidation-related activity in the MTL, we performed ANCOVA to regress out the task-evoked activation (mean beta estimate of each voxel). \n\n\n### Encoding fMRI Data Analysis \n  \nEncoding fMRI data pre-processing was similar to resting fMRI data, including slice timing, realignment, normalization and smoothing (4 mm FWHM). Individual statistical models were constructed in SPM8 for each participant using a general linear model (GLM). Statistical contrasts were constructed to compare picture encoding with zero. In the second level analysis, one-sample T-tests were applied to identify regions activated by GLM. The positive activation map (  p  <0.05, cluster size >270 mm ) obtained by the one-sample T-tests was taken as encoding-related ROIs for resting-state analysis. We also compared the activation between the two groups using two-sample T-test. Brain regions above combination threshold of   p  <0.05 and cluster size >2295 mm  were considered as significantly different between groups. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral Results \n  \nThe demographic and behavioral data are listed in  . There were no significant differences in age, gender, IQ score and d-prime score (all   p  ’s >0.05). \n   Demographic data and behavior performance of two APOE groups.        \n\n### RS-fMRI Results in MTL \n  \nIn MTL ROI, two sample t-test showed that the ReHo ratio in APOE ε3/ε4 group was significantly larger than that in APOE ε2/ε3 group (  p  <0.05, two-tailed, small volume correction (SVC)) ( ). Paired t-tests revealed that the APOE ε3/ε4 group showed significant higher ReHo in REST-2 than in REST-1 in MTL ROI (  t   = 3.789,   p   = 0.001), but no significant ReHo difference was observed between REST-1 and REST-2 in the APOE ε2/ε3 group (  t   = 0.569,   p   = 0.576) ( , respectively). Furthermore, the ReHo ratio showed significantly positive correlation with d-prime, an index of recognition memory performance, obtained from the retrieval stage in APOE ε3/ε4 group (  p  <0.05, SVC), but the correlation was not significant in APOE ε2/ε3 group in this ROI ( ). It should be noted that this correlation analysis was performed within the cluster in which the voxels showed significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups. Using ANCOVA to regress out the task-evoked activation, the significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups remained (  p  <0.05, SVC). \n   Memory consolidation-related changes in the MTL.  \n(A): Significant higher ReHo ratio in APOE ε3/ε4 group than ε2/ε3 group.

Paired t-tests showed higher ReHo of REST-2 than that of REST-1 in the two groups in the occipital area (APOE ε2/ε3:   t   = 6.928,   p   = 0.001; APOE ε3/ε4:   t   = 3.401,   p   = 0.003) ( ) but in the parietal area, only in APOE ε2/ε3 group (  t   = 5.134,   p   = 0.001) ( ). Furthermore, in the occipital area, ReHo ratio showed a significantly negative correlation with the recognition memory performance (d-prime value) in APOE ε2/ε3 group (  p  <0.05, SVC), but showed no significant correlation in APOE ε3/ε4 group ( ). It should be noted that this correlation analysis was performed within the visual cortex in which the voxels showed significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups (upper part of  ). The above results may indicate that the encoding area is more involved in memory consolidation in APOE ε2/ε3 group during a relatively early stage of memory consolidation than done in APOE ε3/ε4 group. \n   Memory consolidation-related changes in the encoding-related brain areas.  \n(A): Significant higher ReHo ratio in APOE ε2/ε3 group than ε3/ε4 group in the occipital cortex bilaterally (upper) and left superior parietal lobule (lower).

The results of our study showed that APOE ε4 carriers may have a different episodic memory consolidation process, and this memory consolidation process is not affected by encoding effects. Our study of memory consolidation showed the gene effects on memory consolidation and provided a new sight in memory consolidation process in memory-related disease. This study also suggests that the RS-fMRI may serve as an effective approach for investigating spontaneous memory consolidation of the human brain. \n\nReHo is a measurement of local synchronization of BOLD signals. ReHo had been used in many brain disorder studies. In epilepsy studies, ReHo had detected the abnormally increase local synchronization within the epileptic focus, such as increased ReHo in MTL of temporal lobe epilepsy patients   and increased ReHo in the thalamus of generalized tonic-clonic seizures  . Based on these evidences, the increased ReHo after a memory task may suggest an increased local synchronization of neural activity related to off-line memory consolidation. \n\nAlthough APOE ε4 young healthy carriers showed significantly greater ReHo ratio than non-carriers in MTL, the two groups did not show significant differences in recognition memory performance (i.e., d-prime,   p   = 0.73), being consistent with a previous study which did not find significant differences in memory performance between young (<50 years old) APOE ε4 healthy carriers and non-carriers  . The increased ReHo ratio of spontaneous activity in APOE ε4 healthy carriers may indicate a compensative off-line memory consolidation process, which may have resulted in similar recognition memory performance for the two groups during subsequent memory retrieval stage. The significantly positive correlation between ReHo ratio and recognition memory performance observed only in ε4 carriers also supports this interpretation. The decreased memory consolidation-related spontaneous activity may lead to worse memory performance in aged APOE ε4 carriers. \n\nThere is a possibility that the different consolidation effect after task was a direct consequence of different encoding activation of the preceding task between the two groups. Previous fMRI studies comparing the activation during encoding between successful encoding and failure encoding showed that the activation of encoding can predict the memory performance (subsequent memory effect)  ,  . Greater functional activation in MTL during encoding has been reported in young APOE ε4 healthy carriers than non-carriers  , and our results also showed greater encoding related activation in the right MTL in the APOE ε3/ε4 group than in APOE ε2/ε3 group. However, the significant difference in ReHo ratio between the two groups remained after the task-evoked activation was regressed out. This result suggests that the consolidation effect is largely independent of the encoding activation. The different activation during encoding does not account for the different memory consolidation in the MTL. Therefore, it is essential to focus on memory consolidation process. \n\nThe results in neo-cortex also showed that the local spontaneous activity in the areas where picture encoding occurs was modulated by the task. Albert et al. showed that a resting state fronto-parietal network that is believed to be involved in visuomotor processing was modulated by motor learning, but not by motor performance  . Tambini et al. showed that after a task with higher associative memory performance rather than poor memory performance, the magnitude of resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampal and lateral occipital complex was altered  . The results from animal and human studies support the system consolidation theory, which hypothesized that the MTL (mainly hippocampus and parahippocampus) is required for initial storage and recall and that the neo-cortex is considered as the area where remote memory is stored  – . The role of the visual cortex in memory consolidation remains unclear. In addition to visual perception and representation, studies have shown that the visual cortex is important for visual recognition memory and visual learning  . An RS-fMRI study showed that the changes in functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortex were involved in memory consolidation  . Our results provide evidence of association between the local spontaneous activity in the visual cortex and episodic memory consolidation. The difference in ReHo ratio between the two genotype groups in the visual cortex and hippocampus may suggest a different mechanism of memory consolidation for APOE ε4 carriers. \n\nSeveral limitations should be addressed. First, the off-line memory consolidation is a time dependent and dynamic process  . We only collected the data of 8–16 min after encoding. The dynamic course of off-line memory consolidation for a specific brain area needs to be further investigated. System consolidation suggests the transfer between the MTL and neo-cortex during consolidation. In our study, we just focused on the activity in the MTL and neo-cortex separately. Second, we did not collect neuropsychological data of episodic memory tests which are widely used in MCI and AD studies while we only performed correlation analysis between ReHo ratio and retrieval performance. Third, we did not include APOE ε3/ε3, the most common genotype in population, and therefore, the differences in ReHo between APOE ε2/ε3 and ε3/ε4 might not be attributed to the differences in ReHo between ε4 carriers and other genotype carriers. Finally, abnormal activation during memory encoding stage has been widely reported in aMCI and AD patients  ,  ,  . However, no imaging study has been carried out to investigate the spontaneous memory consolidation stage in aMCI or AD patients. The current results may shed new light on the mechanism of episodic memory deficit in AD. It would be interesting to determine if there is a vulnerable period of off-line memory consolidation for aMCI or early AD patients. If so, a cognitive therapy might be developed. \n\n### Conclusion \n  \nIn summary, we provide the first demonstration of memory consolidation process of different APOE carriers in the specific areas (such as MTL and encoding related areas) by using RS-fMRI. We found that both in MTL and encoding related neo-cortex showed memory consolidation related activity change after episodic memory encoding. And the mechanism of off-line episodic memory consolidation is different in APOE ε4 carriers. \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"78bb89057d6d5f3dae4ada299e517fd7"},

However, whether and how we predict   multisensory   action outcomes remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms in a context where actions have outcomes in different modalities. During fMRI data acquisition auditory, visual and auditory-visual stimuli were presented in active and passive conditions. In the active condition, a self-initiated button press elicited the stimuli with variable short delays (0-417ms) between action and outcome, and participants had to detect the presence of a delay for auditory or visual outcome (task modality). In the passive condition, stimuli appeared automatically, and participants had to detect the number of stimulus modalities (unimodal/bimodal). For action consequences compared to identical but unpredictable control stimuli we observed   suppression   of the blood oxygen level depended (BOLD) response in a broad network including bilateral auditory and visual cortices. This effect was independent of task modality or stimulus modality and strongest for trials where no delay was detected (undetected<detected). In bimodal vs. unimodal conditions we found activation differences in the left cerebellum for detected vs. undetected trials and an increased cerebellar-sensory cortex connectivity. Thus, action-related predictive mechanisms lead to BOLD suppression in multiple sensory brain regions. These findings support the hypothesis of multisensory predictive mechanisms, which are probably conducted in the left cerebellum. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nPerceiving one`s own actions and related sensory action consequences is essential to successfully interact with the environment. One’s own action consequences are highly predictable and therefore require less sensory resources than the processing of unpredictable external events. Predictive mechanisms allow us to anticipate the future state of both the environment and ourselves in order to compensate for delays in the transmission of neural signals and distinguish external events from the sensory consequences of our own actions [ ]. Predictions are found at different levels of processing, from simple eye movements to complex motor acts or language processing, and they have even been identified as one of the defining functions of the human brain [ ]. Efference copies [ ,  ] of motor outputs can be used to predict re-afferent sensory feedback (see [ ], for a review). They modulate the response properties of the corresponding sensory cortex and prepare it for re-afferent stimuli [ ]. This is known as the forward model (e.g., [ ,  ]) which presumably increases the efficiency of attention and cognitive processing by preventing the central nervous system from wasting neural resources on irrelevant sensory stimuli [ ]. This process also allows sensory re-afferents from motor outputs to be recognised as the self-generated result of an action. So far, ‘predictive mechanisms’ on a neural level have only been studied for single modalities such as responses to tactile [ – ], visual [ – ] or auditory stimuli [ ]. Since real-world actions usually stimulate several senses simultaneously (e.g., seeing, feeling and hearing my own hands clapping), the question arises whether and how we predict   multisensory   action outcomes. \n\nMultisensory processing mechanisms have often been related to facilitation in a variety of tasks [ ]. In these cases it has been assumed that events in a modulating modality (e.g., a sound) may render a particular space (and/or time) salient for another modality (e.g., a visual stimulus), to facilitate modality-specific processing for that time or place in the latter modality ([ – ]; see [ ], for a review). However, the challenge for the brain is to connect the different kind of information in a suitable way, especially because in an early stage different unisensory brain regions, e.g. auditory and visual cortices, are in charge of processing incoming information. The cerebellum is a good candidate brain region which might contribute to the prediction of multisensory action outcomes, since it is relevant for visual and auditory processing, timing, perceptual sequencing and predictive processing and is functional connected to visual and auditory sensory cortices (see [ ] for an overview). Despite the fact that first behavioral evidence suggests the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms for auditory-visual action consequences [ ], the neural correlates of these processes remain unknown. Therefore, the current study focused on the neural processing of multisensory consequences of one’s own action. \n\nThe principles of action prediction have been investigated with paradigms probing anticipated action effects. Behaviorally, it has been shown that self-generated stimuli are perceived as less intense compared to externally generated stimuli, a phenomenon known as sensory attenuation [ ]. Sensory attenuation has been demonstrated in the somatosensory [ ], auditory [ ] and visual domains ([ ,  ]; see [ ] for a review). These behavioral studies have been complemented by electrophysiological correlates of anticipated action effects (e.g., [ ,  – ]). Studies using fMRI suggest an involvement of the cerebellum in predicting action outcomes [ ,  ,  ,  ] and provide evidence for BOLD suppression for predictable compared to unpredictable (e.g., delayed) action outcomes in visual [ ,  ,  ], auditory [ ] and somatosensory [ – ,  – ] brain regions. However, up till now, sensory suppression at neural level has only been studied for individual modalities separately. Thus, whether actions with potential consequences in multiple modalities lead to BOLD suppression in multiple sensory processing areas in the brain is unknown. \n\nVarious tasks have been used to study predictive mechanisms and related sensory suppression at a neural level. These include looking at active action conditions in which the consequences are remapped to new spatial (e.g., real vs. rotated feedback of the hand [ ]), temporal (e.g., delayed feedback [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]) or unpredictable (e.g., passive movement or other control conditions [ – ]) outcomes. Delay detection tasks, in which a short interval between one’s own action and the resulting perceptual consequences has to be detected, have several advantages for studying predictive mechanisms [ ,  ,  ,  ]: because they 1) focus participants’ attention on the perceptual consequences of an action, 2) make it possible to compare subjectively instantaneous trials (in which reafferent feedback matches the prediction) with delayed trials (in which feedback is unpredictable), and 3) can be applied to action outcomes in multiple modalities. Up to now, delay detection tasks have only been applied to single modalities in imaging studies. However, on behavioral level we successfully applied the delay detection task to multiple modalities and found evidence for bimodal facilitation for the detection of delays [ ]. \n\nIn the current study, the neural correlates of predicting multisensory action consequences were investigated using fMRI, by adopting the basic design of the behavioural study [ ]. In an active condition, self-initiated hand movements (button presses) elicited the presentation of stimuli in the visual and auditory modality with variable short delays (0–417 ms) between the action and its outcome. In a passive control condition, the same auditory, visual and auditory-visual stimuli were presented, unconnected to the participant’s actions (participants did not move) and consequently unpredictable. In the active condition, participants had to detect delays between action and feedback. Thus, although technically there were more delayed trials than non-delayed trials, the participants’ default temporal prediction was set to a delay of 0ms, by explicitly instructing participants to detect sensory information that deviated temporally from this action-based expectation. In the passive condition, participants only had to report whether they saw a unimodal or bimodal stimulus. Since real life actions (e.g., hand clapping or knocking on a door) usually have multisensory consequences we hypothesized that both multisensory and unisensory consequences would be predicted (see [ ]) and therefore the corresponding neural signals would be suppressed compared to when the same stimuli were unpredictable. Thus, compared to studies focussing on single modalities and related suppression in respective (uni-)sensory brain regions, we expected BOLD suppression in multiple sensory brain regions (e.g., auditory and visual cortices). Furthermore, we expected that BOLD suppression in auditory and visual sensory cortices would be independent of feedback modality, since visual, auditory and audio-visual consequences were equally predictable. Finally, we expected the strongest suppression effects to occur in trials that were perceived as simultaneous with the action, as for these trials the action consequences occurred as predicted/ in line with the default expectation (i.e. no violation of the temporal contiguity could be detected). \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Participants \n  \n21 healthy, right-handed (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [ ]) participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision took part in the experiment (8 males, age range 19–30, mean age 24.9 years). One participant had to be excluded from the fMRI analysis because of excessive movement, resulting in a sample of twenty participants (8 males, age range 19–30, mean age 25.1 years). For the subsequent analysis comparing detected vs. undetected delays, three further subjects had to be excluded because of their small number of trials per experimental run (see   fMRI data analysis  ), resulting in a final group of seventeen participants (7 males, age range 19–30, mean age 25 years) for the second analysis. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the medical faculty of the Philipps-University Marburg, Germany ( ; registration number: 123/13) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent has been obtained from all participants. \n\n\n### Stimuli and procedure \n  \nDuring fMRI data acquisition participants wore headphones (MR-Confon Optimel, Magdeburg, Germany) through which auditory stimuli were delivered in the form of a pure-tone 250Hz beep (presented for 1 second). The visual stimulus was a black dot (1.5° visual angle), presented (for 1 second) centrally on a medium grey background on a computer screen (refresh rate 60 Hz) positioned behind the scanner. The screen was viewed by the participants in an appropriately angled mirror. Participants placed their right hand on a button pad, with their right index finger touching the button. The button pad was fixed on their right leg. The left index and middle finger were placed on two buttons of a separate button pad located and fixed on the left leg. Stimuli were presented using Octave and the Psychtoolbox [ ]. \n\nThe general paradigm ( ) has been adapted from a previous behavioral study [ ]. However, due to technical reasons an externally-controlled (passive) moving button could not be included in the current imaging study. The participants had to perform button presses with their right index finger, which would elicit the appearance of either the dot on the screen, or the tone, or both. The stimuli were presented either at the time of the button press, or with a variable delay. The participants’ task was to detect the presence of a delay between their button press and the presented stimuli. They answered ‘Yes, there was a delay’ by pressing a button with their left middle finger, or ‘No, there was no delay’ by pressing a button with their left index finger. Participants always had to report the delays in only one modality, referred to as ‘task modality’ in this article. Thus, in bimodal trials participants only had to report whether they detected a delay between their action and the target stimulus, i.e. the stimulus in the other modality (referred to as ‘task-irrelevant modality’) was not important for the task. Participants were instructed at the start of each mini-block (12 trials) about the target stimuli (task modality) via written instruction (auditory task or visual task). There were 5 mini-blocks in each run (in total 60 trials per run). The task order was either visual–auditory–passive–visual–auditory, or auditory–visual–passive–auditory–visual. In active trials the delay between action and stimulus was one of the six predefined delays (0, 83, 167, 250, 333, or 417 ms, presented in frames (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 frames)). In bimodal trials, the two components of the stimulus were always presented together. Unimodal and bimodal trials were randomized within each mini-block. \n   An example of a bimodal trial.  \nIn the active condition (top) participants had to wait with their button press until the cue appeared, and could take as much time as they wanted (max. 4 seconds). After a variable delay, unimodal or bimodal stimuli were presented. Participants had to report whether they detected a delay between their button press and the stimulus of the task modality. In the passive condition (bottom), an identical trial structure was used. However, no button press was performed by the participants and they had just to report whether they perceived one or two stimuli. \n  \nThe procedure during a trial was as follows (see  ). Each trial started with the presentation of a fixation cross presented for a variable intertrial interval (1, 1.5, or 2 seconds), after which a cue appeared in the form of the outline of a square (3.2° visual angle), surrounding the fixation cross. \n\nIn the   active condition  , the cue indicated that from now on, participants could press the button with their right index finger, which triggered the unimodal or bimodal stimulus after a delay of 0-417ms. The participants were instructed to perform button presses at their own pace in a fixed time window up to four seconds after the cue onset. The visual stimulus appeared at the location of the fixation cross, thus obscuring it. For unimodal auditory trials the fixation cross remained visible during the presentation of the tone. The cue and stimuli disappeared at the same time. Subsequent to the offset of the stimuli and cue, there was a variable interval with the fixation cross before the question ‘Delay? Yes/No’ was presented on the screen, after a fixed period of six seconds after cue onset. \n\nIn the   passive condition  , participants were instructed not to press the button when they saw the cue, but to just observe and listen to the presented stimuli. In these trials, the stimuli were presented automatically after a variable delay (0.5–3.5 seconds) followed by a fixation cross. After a fixed period of six seconds after cue onset, participants had to judge whether one or two stimuli had been presented. They answered the question “Two stimuli? Yes/no” with their left middle finger for “Yes, there were two stimuli”, or left index finger for “No, there was only one stimulus”. We introduced this bimodal detection task in order to have a similar trial structure and decision processes in the active and passive conditions. Furthermore, this task was easier than the delay detection task in the active condition. Therefore, it was unlikely that the expected suppression effects in active trials (passive>active) were confounded by an increased task demand in the passive condition. \n\nParticipants were instructed to be as accurate as possible, but were not required to be as fast as possible. They were given up to 2.5 seconds for their answer. Then the next trial started irrespective of the answer. Missing trials were not repeated to maintain a fixed data acquisition procedure for all experimental runs and participants. \n\nPrior to the fMRI experiment, participants were familiarized with the paradigm in a behavioural training outside the scanner. First, they could press the button several times to experience delayed (417 ms) and undelayed feedback. Then, to become familiar with the paradigm, they completed one run, with the same procedure and number of trials (60 trials) as the fMRI experiment in which they were given feedback about their performance (correct or incorrect). Then, they completed two more runs without feedback. Only subjects with a performance higher than 50% correct were invited to the fMRI study. All 21 of the original sample met this criterion. \n\nThe fMRI experiment comprised 300 trials in total: we presented 10 trials for each delay, thus leading to 60 unimodal visual trials (VU), 60 unimodal auditory trials (AU), 60 bimodal visual trials (VB) and 60 bimodal auditory trials (AB). Furthermore, unimodal and bimodal passive control conditions were presented: 20 trials visual unimodal (CV), 20 trials auditory unimodal (CA) and 20 trials bimodal (CB). Stimuli were presented in a rapid event-related fMRI design which was divided into five runs, each comprising 60 trials with 5 mini-blocks. \n\n\n### Analysis of the behavioral data \n  \nPercent delay responses per condition (VU, AU, VB, AB) were used to compare performance between conditions. Additionally, the average delay per condition (detected: VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d; undetected: VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd) were calculated and compared as pseudo-depended variable (see [ ] for a comparable approach). Finally, the button press latencies between conditions were compared and correlated with the respective performance per condition to explore potential relationships and to rule out potential confounds due to differences in button press latencies between conditions. \n\nRepeated-measures ANOVAs were performed using SPSS on the percent delay responses and average delays, which were calculated for each participant individually. In the analysis, unimodal trials were compared to all bimodal trials together. Posthoc t-tests (Bonferroni corrected) were conducted to verify the direction of the effects. \n\n\n### fMRI data acquisition \n  \nMRI data were collected using a Siemens 3 Tesla MR Magnetom Trio Trim scanner. In order to minimize head motion artefacts, participants’ heads were fixed using foam pads. \n\nFor each experimental run a total of 396 transversal functional images (echo-planar images, 64 x 64 matrix; 34 slices descending; field of view [FoV] = 230 mm; repetition time [TR] = 1650 ms; echo time [TE] = 30 ms; flip angle = 70°; slice thickness = 4.0 mm, gap size: 15%, and voxel resolution = 3 x 3 x 4.6 mm) that covered the whole brain (incl. cerebellum) and were positioned parallel to the intercommissural line (anterior commissure–posterior commissure) were recorded. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nMagnetic resonance images were analyzed using standard routines of Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12;  ) implemented in MATLAB 7.9 (Mathworks, Sherborn, Massachusetts). For data preprocessing, standard realignment, coregistration between structural and functional scans, segmentation, normalisation (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] template 2 x 2 x 2 mm) and smoothing (8mm) functions of SPM12 were applied. \n\nFor single subject analyses, realignment parameters were included as regressors of no interest to account for movement artifacts. Low frequencies were removed using a high-pass filter with a cut-off period of 128 seconds. For the first set of analyses, the hemodynamic response triggered by each visual, auditory or bimodal stimulus of each condition (VU, AU, VB, AB, VC, AC, BC) was modeled with a canonical HRF. For the second set of analyses, active trials were additionally divided into those where delays were detected (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d) and those where delays were not detected (VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd) leading to eight conditions. Additionally, button presses were included as single additional condition (not separated for modality) of no interest in the single subject models. Of note, the modulation of button presses had a significant effect on the result pattern, when comparing active vs. passive trials. Therefore, we provide additional information in the results section, when results are highly dependent on the modulation of button presses. Parameter estimates (b) and t-statistic images were calculated for each subject. \n\nAt the group level (second level analysis), we first performed a random effects group analysis by entering the parameter estimates for seven conditions (VU, AU, VB, AB, VC, AC, BC) into a flexible factorial analysis. In a second flexible factorial group analysis, contrast images of the active conditions separated for detected and undetected trials were entered (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d, VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd). \n\nTo correct for errors of multiple comparisons, we employed family wise error correction (FWE) implemented in SPM12 at p < 0.05. To avoid type II error, we further explored results at p < 0.001 uncorrected, with a cluster extent of 50 contiguous resampled voxels. This threshold is more liberal than the FWE correction but still exceeds a cluster threshold calculated by monte-carlo simulations ( ; see [ ]), which suggested 47 activated continuous voxels at   p   < 0.001 uncorrected are sufficient to correct for multiple comparisons at cluster level (p < .05). \n\nThe reported voxel coordinates of activation peaks correspond to the MNI space (ICBM standard). For anatomical localization functional data were referenced to the AAL toolbox [ ] and the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps [ ]. \n\nExploratory connectivity analyses in the form of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses, were conducted to better explain the condition specific association between activation change in auditory and visual cortices and the observed results in the cererebellum, motor cortex and SMA. \n\n#### Contrasts of interest \n  \nFollowing our hypotheses, contrasts of interest focused on sensory suppression as reflected in activation differences between active and control conditions (active action feedback < passive control conditions) as well as subjectively delayed vs. undelayed trials (detected > undetected). Interaction effects of task and feedback modality were calculated to explore specific effects for multisensory processing of action consequences. Finally, correlation analyses with behavioural data were performed to explore the relationship between BOLD suppression and behaviour. \n\nAnalyses were structured in two steps. First, all active action feedback conditions (VU, AU, VB, AB) were contrasted with respective control conditions (VC, AC and BC), to test for action-dependent BOLD suppression across conditions (VU<VC, AU<AC, VB<BC and AB<BC). Conjunction analyses (minimum t-statistics; [ ]) were applied to test for task- and modality-independent BOLD suppression (VU<VC ∩ AU<AC ∩ VB<BC ∩ AB<BC). In a second step, trials where delays had been detected (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d) were separated from trials where delays had not been detected (VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd) for each active condition. With this analysis we first tested specifically for BOLD suppression for undetected conditions (detected > undetected) in sensory brain regions (auditory/visual cortices) by applying an inclusive masking procedure using the result pattern of the first analyses (conjunction analysis; see  ), then we explored the general neural processes related to the detection of delays (detected>undetected) using whole brain analyses. Finally, interaction analyses were applied to test for effects of task (visual/auditory) and modality (unimodal/bimodal) on the neural processing of action consequences subjectively perceived as delayed compared to those perceived as undelayed conditions (detected/undetected). \n    Processing of action consequences compared to unpredictable control stimuli (conjunction analysis across conditions  : VU<VC ∩ AU<AC ∩ VB<BC ∩ AB<BC).        \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \n depicts behavioral performance as percent delay responses (A, left) and averaged delay per condition (B, right) across all participants. A repeated-measures ANOVA performed on the percent delay responses using the factors modality (unimodal vs bimodal) and task (visual vs auditory) revealed a significant main effect of modality and of task (F(1,19) = 6.809, p = 0.017,   η   = 0.264 and F(1,19) = 9.541, p = 0.006,   η   = 0.334, respectively). The interaction between these factors was not significant (F(1,19) = 2.861, p = 0.107,   η   = 0.131). Analysis of the average delays per condition revealed significant main effects for detection (detected vs. undetected, F(1,19) = 1444.512, p < 0.001,   η   = 0.987), task (auditory vs. visual, F(1,19) = 7.300, p = 0.014,   η   = 0.278) and a trend for modality (unimodal vs. bimodal, F(1,19) = 4.274, p = 0.053,   η   = 0.184). Additionally we revealed significant modality*task (F(1,19) = 4.455, p = 0.048,   η   = 0.190) as well as detection*task interactions (F(1,19) = 4.597, p = 0.045,   η   = 0.195). However, the modality*detection and modality*task*detection interaction did not reach significance (F(1,19) = 0.201, p = 0.659,   η   = 0.010 and F(1,19) = 2.397, p = 0.138,   η   = 0.112, respectively). \n  \n Behavioural results as percent delay responses (A, left) and averaged delay per condition (B, right) across all participants.   In both tasks, bimodal trials showed more delay responses than unimodal trials. Furthermore, there was a trend for lower average delay for detected bimodal compared to detected unimodal trials, indicating that more trials with small delays had been detected in bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. \n  \nAnalysis of ‘button press latencies’ (time used to press the button) per condition revealed no significant main effects (unimodal vs. bimodal, F(1,19) = 0.542, p = 0.470,   η   = 0.028, and auditory vs. visual, F(1,19) = 3.903, p = 0.063,   η   = 0.170) or modality*task interaction (F(1,19) = 0.353, p = 0.559,   η   = 0.018). Furthermore, explorative correlation analyses revealed no significant correlation between the individual time used to press the button and performance in any condition. \n\nPerformance for the bimodal detection task during passive conditions was very high (PV: mean = 98.33%, SD = 4.36; PA: mean = 98.75%, SD = 3.05; PB: mean = 97.91%, SD = 3.70) and there were no significant differences between conditions (  p   > 0.494). \n\n\n### fMRI results: Processing of action consequences compared to unpredictable control stimuli \n  \nThe comparison of the responses to action consequences (active conditions) compared to the responses to unpredictable control stimuli (passive conditions) revealed for each condition (see  ; VU<VC; AU<AC; VB<BC; AB<BC) activation reduction in the active conditions in a widespread neural network, including bilateral posterior occipital cortices, bilateral temporal cortices and predominantly left motor cortical areas. Conjunction analyses across conditions (VU<VC ∩ AU<AC ∩ VB<BC ∩ AB<BC) suggest that this suppression effect is quite independent of task or stimulus modality (see  ,  ). The inverse contrast (active>control) revealed activity in the right pre-/postcentral gyrus (MNI: x = 38, y = -22, z = 54; t = 9.72; cluster extension = 796 voxels), the left medial occipital lobe (MNI: x = -4, y = -86, z = -8; t = 7.91; cluster extension = 2742 voxels), lingual gyrus/precuneus (MNI: x = 12, y = -54, z = 2; t = 5.29; cluster extension = 36 voxels) and the left hippocampus (MNI: x = -26, y = -36, z = 10; t = 5.13; cluster extension = 8 voxels). \n   BOLD suppression for the processing of action consequences in contrast to unpredictable identical control stimuli.  \n(A). Conjunction analysis for the suppression effect (active<control) across conditions (VU<VC ∩ AU<AC ∩ VB<BC ∩ AB<BC). (B). Contrast estimates (extracted eigenvariates) of the activation clusters in the right auditory (dark gray) and visual (light gray) cortex, respectively. Each bar represents the amount of suppression as contrast between active auditory, visual or audio-visual consequences minus respective auditory, visual or audio-visual control conditions. (C). Suppression effects for each individual condition. VU: visual unimodal, AU: auditory unimodal, VB: visual bimodal, AB: auditory bimodal, VC: visual unimodal control, AC: auditory unimodal control, BC: bimodal control. P < .05, FWE corrected for multiple comparisons. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. \n  \nWhen button presses were not included as condition of no interest the contrast active>control revealed predominantly broad activation of the left motor cortex (MNI: x = -44, y = -18, z = 64; t = 10.45; cluster extension = 6336 voxels), reflecting the right hand finger movement. The general suppression effect (control>active) in the bilateral visual (MNI: x = 38, y = -54, z = -14; t = 5.21, p = 0.012 FWE, MNI: x = 46, y = -52, z = -12; t = 4.32, p = 0.258 FWE) and auditory cortices (MNI: x = 52, y = -50, z = 18; t = 4.69, p = 0.080 FWE; MNI: x = -64, y = -44, z = 10; t = 2.70, p = 0.004 uncorrected) was weaker, but still present. However, the predominantly left motor cortical suppression effect switched to the right hemisphere (MNI: x = 36, y = -16, z = 52; t = 5.46; cluster extension = 860 voxels). Thus, activation of the active/passive comparison, especially in the motor cortices, has to be interpreted with caution. \n\n#### Correlation of activation suppression and behavioral data \n  \nRegarding delay responses, we found for the VB condition a negative relationship between proportion of delay responses and activation in the left (r = -0.507, p = 0.023, two tailed, uncorrected) and right visual cortex (r = -0.534, p = 0.015, two tailed, uncorrected). For the VU condition only the negative relationship between proportion of delay responses and activation in the right visual cortex was significant (r = -0.467, p = 0.038, two tailed, uncorrected; see Table A in   for all results). This result indicates that lower neural activation (stronger suppression) is related to better performance (increased proportion of detected delays), speaking for a more efficient processing (at least in the visual task conditions). No significant positive correlations were observed. Thus, it is unlikely that activation reduction in active conditions reflects simply an interference with (or distraction due to) the additional button press task. \n\nCorresponding to the correlations with the proportion of delay responses, we found for the VB condition a positive relationship between the average delays for detected trial and activation in the left (r = 0.693, p < 0.001, two tailed, uncorrected) and right visual cortex (r = -0.689, p < 0.001, two tailed, uncorrected). For the VU condition the positive relationship between average delay and activation in the right visual cortex reached significance at a trend level (r = 0.385, p = 0.094, two tailed, uncorrected; see Table B in   for all results). This result indicates that lower neural activation (stronger suppression) is related to better performance (reduction of average delays), as shorter delays were detected. Interestingly activation in auditory cortices was positively correlated to average delays in the VB condition, too (left r = 0.487, p = 0.029; right r = 0.526, p = 0.017). No significant negative correlations were observed. \n\n\n\n### fMRI results: Processing of subjective delayed (delay detected) and undelayed (delay undetected) trials. \n  \nIn the second analysis, for each active condition, trials where delays had been detected (VU-d, AU-d, VB-d, AB-d) were separated from trials where delays had not been detected (VU-nd, AU-nd, VB-nd, AB-nd). With this analysis we first tested more specifically for BOLD suppression for undetected conditions (detected > undetected, masked) in primary sensory brain regions by applying an inclusive masking procedure using the result pattern of the first analyses (conjunction analyses; see  ) as mask. We found no effects by applying the conservative FWE correction for multiple comparisons. However, on the more liberal threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected, 50 voxels) we found indeed BOLD suppression (detected>undetected) in bilateral occipital (MNI: x = -16, y = -96, z = -6; t = 4.76, cluster extension = 311 voxels, p < .012 FWE cluster correction; MNI: x = 24, y = -92, z = -14; t = 4.31; cluster extension = 99 voxels) and temporal (MNI: x = 60, y = -28, z = 8; t = 4.37; cluster extension = 81 voxels; MNI: x = -56, y = -32, z = 12; t = 3.88; cluster extension = 60 voxels) brain regions (see  ). These data are in line with the hypothesis that the better prediction for undelayed trials (e.g., due to the temporal contiguity) lead to greater activation reduction in auditory and visual cortices compared to more unpredictable delayed trials. Note, this analyses was less affected by the button press condition of no interest. We found also BOLD suppression (detected>undetected) in bilateral occipital (MNI: x = -16, y = -94, z = -6; t = 4.22; MNI: x = 26, y = -92, z = -12; t = 3.59) and temporal (MNI: x = 60, y = -28, z = 8; t = 3.65; MNI: x = -52, y = -32, z = 14; t = 3.08) brain regions when not controlling for the button press. \n  \n Suppression effects for subjectively undelayed (undetected delay) compared to delayed (detected delay) trials in visual (A, top) and auditory (B, bottom) cortices.   Data are inclusively masked by the suppression effect illustrated in  . The lack of effects in the visual cortex for auditory unimodal trials and in the auditory cortex for visual unimodal trials may be due to the fact that detected trials for these conditions led to high activation in brain regions related to the respective task modality only. Interestingly, in bimodal trials suppression was observed in both modalities. Bar graphs at the right illustrate suppression effects in visual (top) and auditory (bottom) cortices across conditions as a function of the delay between the action and the stimulus. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. P < 0.001 uncorrected with a cluster extend of 50 voxels. \n  \nFor general neural processes related to the detection of delays (detected > undetected; unmasked), we found effects in the left parahippocampus (MNI: x = -30, y = -34, z = -12; t = 5.58; cluster extension = 27 voxels), the right precuneus (MNI: x = 14, y = -60, z = 22; t = 5.53; cluster extension = 19 voxels) and the left putamen/insula (MNI: x = -28, y = -2, z = -2; t = 5.16; cluster extension = 7 voxels). At a more liberal threshold (p < 0.001, 50 voxels), we revealed a more distributed network comprising the medial prefrontal lobe and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC/PCC), the temporal poles, as well as parietal and hippocampal structures (see   and  ). The opposite contrast (undetected>detected) revealed two clusters of activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus (MNI: x = 52, y = 20, z = 6; t = 4.42, p < 0.001 uncorrected; cluster extension = 149 voxels; MNI: x = 34, y = 26, z = -6; t = 3.93, p < 0.001 uncorrected; cluster extension = 73 voxels). \n   FMRI results for subjectively undelayed (undetected delay) compared to delayed (detected delay) trials (p < 0.001 uncorrected with a cluster extent of 50 voxels).  \nThe bar graph illustrates the contrast estimates of the left hippocampus cluster (at p < 0.05 FWE) and the bilateral ACC cluster (p < 0.001 uncorrected; for statistics see  ). \n     Processing of subjective delayed (delay detected) and undelayed (delay undetected) trials at a liberal threshold (  p   < .001 uncorrected, cluster extent: 50 voxels).        \nControl analyses comparing detected versus undetected trials matched for delay revealed a similar pattern of activation as illustrated in Figs   and   (detected>undetected; see Fig B in  ). Although only the 167ms delay could be included in this post-hoc control analysis, these results suggest that the previously reported results are not just due to the physical delay, but are also related to awareness of delay. \n\n#### fMRI results: Interaction effects \n  \nInteraction analyses were applied to explore the effect of task (visual/auditory) and modality (unimodal/bimodal) on the neural processing of trials subjectively perceived as delayed compared to undelayed (detected/undetected). We found no effects by applying the conservative FWE correction for multiple comparisons. However, at a more liberal threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected, 50 voxels) we found a significant interaction effect for task (auditory/visual) by modality (unimodal/bimodal) in the left cerebellum (62.0% in left lobule VI (Hem.), 9.3% in lobule V (Hem.)) with cluster extensions to the fusiform gyrus (16.7% in area FG3, MNI: x = -32, y = -48, z = -26; F = 20.41, cluster extension = 182 voxels, p < 0.053 FWE cluster corrected; see  ). Contrast estimates of the respective cluster (extracted eigenvariates; bar graph on the left in  ) illustrate a specific activation for detected compared to undetected trials in the bimodal conditions (independent of task modality). This effect is mainly driven by significant differences between detected and undetected trials in the bimodal conditions (detected>undetected, MNI: x = -30, y = -34, z = -28; t = 5.82, cluster extension = 156 voxels, p < 0.001 FWE corrected) and no significant modulation in the unimodal conditions (p > 0.001 uncorrected). No other interaction effect revealed significant results at the chosen threshold (p < 0.001 uncorrected, 50 voxels). \n   The cerebellum: Interaction and PPI results.  \n(A) Activation of the left cerebellum with cluster extensions in the left fusiform gyrus for the interaction of delay detection (detected/undetected) and modality (unimodal/bimodal). Contrast estimates (extracted eigenvariates) of the respective cluster (bar graph on the left) illustrate a specific activation for detected compared to undetected trials in the bimodal conditions (independent of task modality). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. P < 0.001 uncorrected with a cluster extent of 50 voxels. (B) Connectivity results (PPI analyses) for the left cerebellum and seed regions in the right auditory ( ) and left visual cortex ( ). The bar graph illustrates the connectivity strength (arbitrary units, a.u.) of the cerebellum cluster (extracted eigenvariates from the PPI group analyses) and respective seed regions for unimodal (dark gray) and bimodal (light gray) conditions. Connectivity strength increased in bimodal conditions probably due to the additional task irrelevant stimulus. \n  \nTo further understand how the neural processing of auditory and visual action outcomes is related to the neural processing in the left cerebellum, we additionally conducted exploratory connectivity analyses in the form of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analyses. Seed regions in the right auditory ( ) and left visual cortex ( ) were selected, as they demonstrated the most prominent suppression effect (highest t-values in the second analyses, see above) in the auditory and visual cortices (see  ). To test for specific effects of bimodal vs. unimodal conditions on connectivity strength between the seed regions and the left cerebellum, eigenvariates of the left cerebellum cluster (identified in the stimulus type*detected interaction; see  ) were extracted from respective PPI analyses and further analyzed using SPSS. A repeated-measures ANOVA performed on the extracted data using the factors modality (unimodal vs. bimodal) and audio/visual processing (visual vs. auditory cortex) revealed a significant main effect of modality (F(1,19) = 5.411, p = 0.031,   η   = 0.222), indicating increased connectivity in bimodal compared to unimodal conditions (see  ). The main effect audio/visual processing (F(1,19) = 1.677, p = 0.211,   η   = 0.081) and the interaction between these factors were not significant (F(1,19) = 0.259, p = 0.617,   η   = 0.013). Connectivity strength increased in bimodal conditions (see  ) probably due to the additional task-irrelevant stimulus. \n\nWhereas exploratory analyses for the left motor cortex (pre-/postcentral gyrus, PRG/PCG) and SMA (see  ,   cluster 1 and 6) revealed general positive connectivity to the seed regions in the auditory and visual cortices (for all conditions: one sample t-tests, p < .05 uncorrected), no significant main effects (PRG/PCG audio/visual processing: F(1,19) = 0.010, p = 0.922,   η   = 0.001; PRG/PCG unimodal/bimodal: F(1,19) = 1.542, p = 0.229,   η   = 0.075; SMA audio/visual processing: F(1,19) = 2.488, p = 0.131,   η   = 0.116; SMA unimodal/bimodal: F(1,19) = 0.346, p = 0.563,   η   = 0.018) or interactions were found regarding task or modality (PRG/PCG: F(1,19) = 0.859, p = 0.366,   η   = 0.043; SMA: F(1,19) = 0.078, p = 0.783,   η   = 0.004). \n\n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nPerforming an action and processing its consequences are usually tightly coupled, making those consequences more predictable than other external events. However, whether and how we predict multisensory action outcomes remains largely unknown. To shed light on this issue, we investigated the neural processing of multisensory consequences of one’s own action using unimodal and bimodal visual and auditory stimuli presented at various delays after a button press, and identical, but action unrelated, unpredictable control stimuli. We observed BOLD suppression in a broad network including bilateral auditory, visual, and sensorimotor brain regions for action consequences compared to the responses to identical, but unpredictable, control stimuli. Suppression was independent of task or stimulus modality and was strongest for subjectively undelayed stimuli. An interaction of modality (unimodal vs. bimodal) by delay detection (detected vs. undetected) revealed activation in the left cerebellum with cluster extensions in the fusiform gyrus. Thus, the internal model and related cerebellar functions prepare the perceptual system for all possible action consequences and probably underlie the behavioral advantage for bimodal versus unimodal conditions. \n\n### Cross-modal action-related suppression \n  \nPrevious studies showing action-related suppression (or corresponding increase of activation for delayed feedback) in the auditory, visual, and somatosensory system have tested these modalities separately (e.g., [ ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]). On the other hand cross-modal audio-visual suppression effects have been reported, but independent of action [ ]. Our data extend these previous results in demonstrating action related BOLD suppression for more than one modality (in auditory and visual cortices) at the same time. In our paradigm, auditory and visual action consequences were equally likely. Consequently, visual and auditory information were equally predictable following a self-initiated button press. \n\nIt has been suggested that the efference copy plays an important role in predicting the sensory consequences of actions, such as various hand movements [ ,  – ]. Many studies have focused on the role of this forward model in predicting visual [ ,  – ], tactile [ ,  ], and auditory [ ,  ] consequences. We found BOLD suppression in both auditory and visual areas after either or both auditory and visual stimuli related to active movement, which suggests that the sensory system is prepared to process any sensory information consequent to a button press. Exploratory correlation analyses suggest that lower neural activation (stronger suppression) in visual cortices was related to better performance (higher detection rate and reduced average delay in detected trial) predominantly for the bimodal visual task condition, speaking for a more efficient processing. Individual differences in multisensory integration and especially the temporal aspects of multisensory binding received increasing attention in recent years, suggesting practical and clinical relevance [ ]. It has been shown, that variations in the temporal binding window (limited range of asynchronies tolerated for perceptual binding) are related to an individual’s ability to integrate multisensory cues [ ]. Our data suggest a relationship between individual differences in temporal processing of action outcomes and BOLD suppression in sensory cortices. Thus, the association of action related predictive mechanisms and individual differences in temporal and multisensory processing remains an important topic for future studies. \n\nNo previous studies have directly tested the prediction of multisensory consequences of one’s own action at the neural level. However, a previous behavioural study from our group found that bimodal action consequences led to an enhancement in the detection of delays between action and feedback, compared to unimodal action consequences, in particular when the task irrelevant stimulus was presented close to the action [ ]. This was interpreted as evidence that the forward model creates predictions for multiple modalities. Here we could replicate the behavioural finding (bimodal enhancement) and extend it to new evidence about the neural correlates. Another behavioural study showed that unpredicted visual stimuli affected loudness perception of auditory stimuli, both for self-generated stimuli and stimuli predicted by a cue [ ]. However, this study investigated the general cross-modal effect of predictability of task-irrelevant stimuli on the perception of the task stimuli without using fMRI methods. In our study, we were specifically interested in the perception of multisensory action consequences compared to unpredictable control stimuli. Few other behavioral studies have included multisensory action consequences to study the sense of agency. For example, Farrer and colleagues found that the presentation of a sound at the time of the button press significantly reduced the thresholds at which participants felt in full control of the appearance of the visual stimulus [ ]. Similarly, lower thresholds were found when additional tones were presented at the time of the button press and visual stimulus in a cross-modal grouping paradigm with variable delayed visual stimuli [ ]. In line with previous behavioural data [ ] our findings point towards the idea that one forward model creates multisensory predictions which consequently leads to bimodal facilitation on a behavioural level and activation reduction in both auditory and visual cortices. \n\n\n### The temporal window of suppression \n  \nTrials in which the participant perceived stimuli temporally aligned with their action (undetected) were accompanied by less neural responses in sensory brain areas as the stimuli that subjects perceived as presented with a delay after their button press. Thus, we observed more BOLD suppression in sensory brain areas when action consequences occurred close to action and were perceived as undelayed. As the task was to detect any delay in sensory feedback, this contrast reflects activity for detected violation of temporal contiguity between action and feedback. Framed differently, the violation of temporal prediction led to activation increase in brain regions relevant for the processing of auditory and visual information. By comparing detected and non-detected trials we could connect BOLD suppression more directly to action, since timing between action and its sensory consequence matters. Suppression was strongest in highly predictable trials in which the participants could detect no delay between action and feedback. That timing matters for sensory suppression could also be demonstrated for example by a MEG study, where N100m suppression in response to pure tones was especially pronounced immediately after articulary lip movements [ ]. This finding has been interpreted as suppression in the auditory cortex being caused by an efference copy from the speech-production system, generated during both own speech and lipreading [ ]. Increased BOLD activity when feedback was delayed and/or the delay was detected has been observed in visual [ ,  ,  ], auditory [ ], and tactile [ ] modalities. However, to our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate this effect for bimodal audio-visual conditions too. \n\n\n### The neural basis of cognitive factors \n  \nThe broad network in which we found differences between detected and non-detected trials included the bilateral hippocampus, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices (ACC, PCC), parietal structures, and the temporal poles. It has been suggested that sensory attenuation is reflected in modulation of both sensory processing (e.g., for auditory or visual stimuli) and processing associated with a reduced engagement of cognitive control in response to an expected sensory event [ ]. This latter modulation could thus be seen as neural processing associated with predictability, such that it is attenuated for predicted stimuli but might also be increased for unexpected stimuli. Thus, frontal, parietal and hippocampal activations for detected compared to non-detected delay trials might reflect cognitive control processes. However, the observed activation pattern including midline structure activations (ACC/PCC) also corresponds to the so-called ‘self-referential network’ [ ,  ]. Thus, self-referential processing load might be especially high when consequences of our own actions deviate from our temporal prediction. Since our participants were explicitly told that they were always the agent, they would have attributed even delayed feedback as the audio/visual consequences of self-action but this would have been in conflict with the usual expectation of zero delay. ACC activation has been found to be involved in conflict monitoring [ ] and its activation here could therefore be a consequence of a prediction of error [ ]. Thus, activation for trials where delays were detected versus trials where delays were not detected could either reflect conflict monitoring, cognitive control processes in response to an unexpected sensory event, or a high self-referential processing load. \n\n\n### The role of the cerebellum \n  \nIn addition to the main effect ‘delay detection’ discussed above, we found a significant interaction of delay detection (detected/non-detected) and modality (unimodal/bimodal) in activation of the left cerebellum (VII) with cluster extensions in the left fusiform gyrus. Contrast estimates of the respective cluster (see bar graph  ) illustrate a specific activation for detected compared to non-detected trials in the bimodal conditions (independent of task modality), an effect that was absent in the unimodal condition. Notably the right cerebellum (VI and VIII) seems to be generally involved across conditions (see   and  ), however, the left cerebellum (VII) seems to be specifically involved in predicting multisensory consequences of one’s own actions. The role of the cerebellum for action feedback prediction has been suggested [ ] and supported by a number of imaging studies focusing on visual [ ,  ] and tactile modalities [ ,  ,  ]. We extend these findings by demonstrating for the first time a specific effect in the left cerebellum related to the processing of multisensory information produced by one’s own actions. The observed activation pattern in the cerebellum could also reflect a multisensory comparator mechanism as it compares expected and perceived auditory-visual signals (e.g., [ ]). It has been proposed that the cerebellum is an important component of the system that provides precise predictions of the sensory consequences of motor commands and acts as a comparator between intended and achieved movement, signalling errors in motor performance and neurophysiological data [ ,  ]. In contrast to previous investigations we provide evidence for a specific role of the left cerebellum in processing multisensory action outcomes. Moreover, this effect was not only absent in the unimodal conditions, but also independent of task modality; i.e. we revealed more activation for detected compared to non-detected delay trials in the cerebellum for both auditory and visual task conditions. Thus, the activation of the left cerebellum might be relevant for explaining the behavioural differences between unimodal and bimodal conditions. Behaviourally, we observed an advantage for bimodal trials, as shown by a significant increase in detection rates compared to unimodal conditions. These behavioural results are in line with our recent behavioural study [ ] and suggest that the forward model generates predictions for auditory AND visual modalities, leading to an advantage for delay detection in bimodal trials. This bimodal advantage might be due to a specific multisensory predictive function of the cerebellum. \n\nIn line with our data, cerebellar activity during tasks involving crossmodal matching had been reported [ ,  – ]. For example, it has been observed that combined audiovisual motion detection led to increased activity bilaterally in cerebellar lobule VI and right lateral crus I, relative to unimodal visual and auditory motion tasks [ ]. In an earlier study, subjects’ ability to detect crossmodal temporal mismatch between simple stationary auditory and visual stimuli was assessed in two separate auditory–visual (AV) and visual–auditory (VA) conditions. Brain regions activated in common to both (AV and VA) conditions, included the left cerebellum [ ]. Together, these results suggest that the cerebellar hemispheres play a role in the detection of multisensory invariant temporal features in concurrent streams of audio-visual information [ ]. \n\nThe PPI analysis suggests that the connectivity between activity of the sensory cortex, which was relevant for the processing of the target stimulus, and the left cerebellum increased in bimodal compared to unimodal conditions. Thus, the task irrelevant stimulus strengthens the functional connectivity (FC). Previous studies focussing on the FC of the cerebellum used resting-state activity (see [ ] for an overview). These methods have contributed to distinguish two anatomic-functional parts of the cerebellum [ ]: a sensorimotor region (lobules V–VI and VIII) and a multimodal cognitive and limbic region (lobule VIIA, especially crus I and II, with adjacent parts of lobule VI and VIIB, and lobule IX). In line with our result FC of the cerebellum to the visual [ – ] and auditory cortex [ ,  ] had been found. A hypothesis is that the cerebellum aids information processing by making predictions, in the form of an “internal model” of sensory events [ ,  ]. Alternatively it has been proposed that the cerebellum facilitates perception by monitoring and coordinating the acquisition of sensory information (see the section by Bower, in [ ]). A third theory is that the cerebellum functions as an internal timing device for both motor and perceptual processes, with different areas of the cerebellum thought to provide separate timing computations for different tasks [ ]. Whereas the differentiation of these theoretical accounts is beyond the scope of the current study, our findings support the relevance of the cerebellum for visual and auditory processing, timing, and specifically the prediction and processing of multisensory action consequences. Whereas activity in the left motor cortex and SMA are also related to auditory and visual cortices, no bi-modality specific effects (as for the cerebellum) could be observed. Thus, the cerebellum generates predictions specifically for multisensory action outcomes, reflected in its increased connectivity to task relevant sensory cortices and neural suppression for subjectively delayed compared to undelayed trials. Ultimately this predictive mechanism might lead to better delay detection rates in bimodal conditions. \n\n\n### Limitations \n  \nDespite the new relevant findings and obvious advantages of our current approach it is important to mention some limitations. They include the relatively abstract stimulus material (button press, dot, and tone), and the fact that our design cannot distinguish between multisensory predictions due to efference copy mechanisms and multisensory predictions due to general temporal predictive mechanisms based on an intentional button press. A passive movement condition would be necessary to test more specifically for the role of efference copy. Such a condition is technically challenging to apply in an MRI environment; however, in a recent behavioral experiment, we did implement a passive movement condition which provides support for the involvement of efference copy in multisensory facilitation [ ]. Within our present fMRI design, an alternative explanation for activation reduction in the active compared to the control conditions could simply be that the button press distracts from the perceptual task. Thus, less neural resources are left to process the auditory and visual stimuli. However, the exploratory correlation analyses demonstrate no positive relationship between BOLD suppression and delay detection rate as well as no negative relationship between BOLD suppression and the average delay of detected trials. For the visual conditions, better performance was correlated with reduced activation in visual sensory cortices suggesting a more efficient processing and arguing strongly against the distraction hypothesis. Nevertheless, the relationship between performance and suppression remains a relevant future research topic. Furthermore, the control of general button press effects is challenging in the applied design, due to the differences in active (button press) and control conditions (no button press) as well as the high temporal correlation between button press and auditory and visual feedback. Consequently, the fMRI analyses considering the button press compared to those neglecting its influence led to changes in the result pattern, predominantly in -but not restricted to- the motor cortices. A better balanced experimental designs and the use of a passive movement device might help to reduce these effects in future. Future studies should also extend our findings to natural outcomes and less constrained actions. However, in a world in which we are surrounded by computers and other devices, it is a common action to press a button and expect a visual and/or auditory consequence, such as when typing a letter or playing a game. Thus, despite the setup being fairly abstract, it can still be considered ecologically valid (c.f., [ ]). Our study is an important first step in unravelling the neural processing of multisensory action consequences. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nIn summary, our results support the existence of multisensory predictive mechanisms in a context where actions can have outcomes in different modalities. We observed BOLD suppression in auditory and visual sensory processing areas for action consequences compared to identical but unpredictable auditory/visual control stimuli and for trials perceived as simultaneous compared to trials in which delays had been detected. Thus, the internal model prepares the perceptual system for all possible action consequences and underlies the behavioural advantage for bimodal versus unimodal conditions. Our results suggest that the left cerebellum is especially relevant for the processing of violations in temporal contiguity between actions and its multisensory consequences. These new results highlight the relevance of multisensory predictive mechanisms for the understanding of how we act in and perceive the world. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"1eb07e8eb06eac72e9dae4beca8bfed9"},

With age, the sensitivity in action prediction declines. In younger adults, the action observation network (AON), consisting of premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal cortices, has been implicated in transforming executed and observed actions into a common code. Much less is known about age-related changes in the neural representation of observed actions. Using fMRI, the present study measured brain activity in younger and older adults during the prediction of temporarily occluded actions (figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). All participants were highly familiar with the movement exercises whereas only some participants were experienced figure skaters. With respect to the AON, the results confirm that this network was preferentially engaged for the more familiar movement exercises. Compared to younger adults, older adults recruited visual regions to perform the task and, additionally, the hippocampus and caudate when the observed actions were familiar to them. Thus, instead of effectively exploiting the sensorimotor matching properties of the AON, older adults seemed to rely predominantly on the visual dynamics of the observed actions to perform the task. Our data further suggest that the caudate played an important role during the prediction of the less familiar figure skating elements in better-performing groups. Together, these findings show that action prediction engages a distributed network in the brain, which is modulated by the content of the observed actions and the age and experience of the observer. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nAs humans, our ability to successfully navigate through our social environment and interact with others is critical for survival. It has been argued that instead of just passively relying on sensory input during the observation of others' actions, we also generate internal predictions on what we see  – . This enables us to adapt and respond more quickly and efficiently to changes in the environment. The ability to create these action predictions is thought to be based on a shared representation between executed and observed actions  ,  . \n\nSo far, research on the prediction of observed actions focused mainly on younger age groups while neglecting changes in these processes over the lifespan. Evidence suggests that there might be a specific decline in how older adults anticipate observed actions, possibly due to less precise internal action representations (e.g.,  – ). In a recent behavioral study, we showed that older adults predicted the time course of different action sequences less precisely than younger adults  . Although the timing in prediction was not systematically biased in older compared to younger adults (i.e., generally slower or faster), older adults did not seem to represent the observed actions in sufficient temporal detail in order to predict their exact time-course. This suggests that age-related differences in prediction performance are unlikely to be accounted for by general changes in time perception (cf.,  ). Our results rather imply an age-related decline in how observed actions are internally mapped onto one's own action representations. We further demonstrated that sensorimotor experience with observed actions resulted in a better prediction performance for domain-specific actions in both older and younger experts compared to non-experts. However, how the process of action prediction is implemented in the aging brain depending on the degree of motor familiarity with the observed actions remains an open question. \n\nIn the light of a demographic change visible in many countries with lower fertility rates and rising life expectancies, a better understanding of age-related changes in these vital abilities together with its neural basis is essential in improving skill learning and skill maintenance in older adults (cf.,  ). It is well known that the aging brain is subject to substantial changes at the structural as well as functional level  – . In addition, older adults exhibit different task-related activation patterns compared to younger adults while performing the same task that could reflect neural dedifferentiation and/or compensation  – . According to the scaffolding theory of aging and cognition (STAC), aging can be viewed as a (intrinsic) challenge to the human brain just as unfamiliar tasks pose a (extrinsic) challenge to a younger brain  . Both types of challenges result in a functional reorganization (i.e., neural scaffolding) to maintain or improve task performance. Whereas neural recruitment patterns in younger adults become increasingly specialized with training, older adults may recruit additional regions already during the performance of familiar tasks to compensate for noisy and/or inefficient neural processing. However, even in older age groups these neural recruitment patterns are amenable to training  . In sensory as well as motor processing, age-related differences in neural activity together with altered functional connectivity have been demonstrated by a number of studies, possibly reflecting less specific neural representations in action   and   perception with advancing age (e.g.,  – ). \n\nIn younger adults, neuroimaging studies on action observation identified regions in the premotor and inferior parietal cortex that are similarly activated during action execution  – . A network comprising these sensorimotor regions as well as occipitotemporal regions implicated in biological motion processing has been referred to as the   action observation network   (AON;  ). By transforming executed and observed actions into a common code, the AON might serve as the neural substrate for the ability to predict the actions of others. According to the predictive coding account, the different regions of the AON are reciprocally connected and an actual representation of the observed action is compared to a predicted representation at each level of the cortical hierarchy  – . This comparison generates a prediction error, which is back propagated through the cortical hierarchy to update the internal action representation and minimize the prediction error. \n\nConsequently, shared representations between action and perception and their neural basis are assumed to be established through sensorimotor experience that strengthens the connectivity between relevant areas  – . Studies on skilled motor performance frequently demonstrate superior prediction abilities in experts when they observe actions from their domain of expertise whereas non-experts rather rely on the visual dynamics of the observed actions resulting in a less efficient anticipation performance (e.g.,  – ). Not surprisingly, AON activity has been shown to be modulated by the sensorimotor experience of the observer. The majority of studies investigating this issue has found increased activity in these regions during the observation of familiar actions as compared to actions that are not in the motor repertoire of the observer (e.g.,  – ). Observers that are not familiar with the shown actions, in contrast, seem to recruit additional regions beyond the AON, for example, in visual cortices to perform these kinds of tasks (e.g.,  ,  ). In addition, recent evidence indicates that specific task requirements and stimulus characteristics might also result in the activation of regions that are not typically considered to be part of the AON during action observation  – . For example, Schiffer and Schubotz   showed that prediction errors during action observation in ambiguous contexts are coded within a sub-region of the basal ganglia, the caudate nucleus. They suggested that the caudate might trigger the updating of the respective internal action representation if the sensory input violates the initial prediction. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are only very few studies so far that examined age-related differences in the neural representation of observed actions. By using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), Léonard and Tremblay   showed that corticomotor facilitation in relevant muscles is less specialized in older compared to younger adults during action observation, imitation, and imagery. In addition, Nedelko et al.   did not report age-related activation differences in the premotor and inferior parietal regions of the AON during observation and imagery of simple goal directed actions. The authors concluded that activity in these regions is age-independent. However, older adults recruited additional regions in the superior parietal and occipital cortices compared to younger adults, which might indicate a different processing of the observed actions (i.e., neural scaffolding). Yet, it remains unclear to what extent the prediction of an observed action is linked to similar changes at the neural level in older adults and whether they are modulated by the degree of motor familiarity in the aging observer. \n\nBy using fMRI, the present study examined the underlying neural activation patterns in younger and older adults during the prediction of action sequences that varied in their degree of motor familiarity (classical figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). All of the participants were highly familiar with the movement exercises, whereas only some of the younger and older adults possessed sensorimotor experience in figure skating. During fMRI scanning, participants were required to judge the temporal coherence of the observed action sequences that were partly occluded at critical time points and whose continuation afterwards was temporarily manipulated. Brain activity was examined as a function of observed action category and continuation after occlusion collapsed across the whole sample as well as a function of age group while controlling for the effects of sensorimotor experience in figure skating. In addition, brain activity between figure skating experts and non-experts was compared to further explore whether neural scaffolding in older adults and inexperienced observers shares a certain degree of similarity (cf.,  ). \n\nSimilar action occlusion paradigms have been used previously to examine action observation and prediction in younger adults (e.g.,  – ). Graf et al.   and Sparenberg et al.  , for example, provided evidence that a pure visual encoding and extrapolation of occluded actions do not seem to be sufficient in order to accomplish the task effectively. They showed that prediction performance for temporarily occluded actions that are presented upside-down is considerably impaired compared to the observation of the same actions presented in an upright perspective. The paradigm also proved successful in measuring neural activity in the AON during action prediction  ,  . Stadler et al.   compared neural activity during the prediction of occluded actions to different action-related control conditions. The authors found that only the dynamic prediction, but not maintenance, of the actions involved activation in parts of the AON. Similarly, Cross et al.   showed that activity in the AON is greater during the prediction of partly occluded action sequences compared to the observation of un-occluded segments of the same action sequences. \n\nWe hypothesized that the type of observed action sequences modulates activity in the AON. In accordance with previous evidence, we expected to find higher AON activity during the prediction of the movement exercises for which the whole sample was highly experienced with. The less familiar figure skating elements, on the contrary, might be processed in regions beyond the AON due to less precise neural representations in an observer's AON. In addition, we assumed that older adults recruit additional brain regions compared to younger adults, implying less specific internal action representations and/or the reliance on different sources of information in line with the assumptions of STAC  . Thus, older adults just as inexperienced observers might perform the task predominantly based on the visual dynamics of the observed actions, which is accompanied with a greater recruitment of visual cortices, respectively. Age-related differences in neural activation patterns might be further modulated by the degree of motor familiarity, for example, in regions known to be involved in episodic memory. \n\n\n## Materials and Methods \n  \n### Ethics statement \n  \nThe study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Leipzig and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants gave written informed consent and received payment for participation. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nA group of 38 participants, comprising younger and older adults, took part in the fMRI experiment. Three participants (one younger adult and two older adults) were excluded from statistical analyses after medical examination of their anatomical scans in which structural abnormalities were diagnosed that might have an influence on their functional images. In addition, one younger adult was excluded due to experience in professional modern dance for six years in adolescence. The final sample consisted of 19 younger (14 women, mean age = 22.6±2.27 years, range 18–27) and 15 older adults (10 women, mean age = 61.1±5.68 years, range 51–71),   t  (32) = 24.7,   p  <0.001. The majority of the participants already took part in the behavioral action prediction experiment reported in Diersch et al.  . One younger adult and four older adults were additionally recruited from the participant database of the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig. Before scanning, these participants were invited for a separate testing session in which they completed the relevant questionnaires and performed the behavioral action prediction task to ensure that the whole sample was scanned under the same prerequisites. Time between the two experimental sessions was 5.35 months on average (range 3–8 months). Characteristics of the sample divided by age group are shown in  . \n   Characteristics of the sample divided by age group.        \nAll participants were right-handed according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory   and reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None of the participants reported current evidence of any major physical or neurological disease and/or use of medication that might affect blood flow. In addition, participants completed different psychometric tests to ensure that only healthy older adults would be included in the experiment. This allowed an examination of age-related changes in action prediction that are unlikely to be confounded by the effects of any age-associated pathology. None of the older adults showed indications of cognitive impairment as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE;  ; Maximum score: 30). The groups did not differ with respect to their reported years of education,   t  (32) = 0.68,   p   = 0.500. In addition, fluid intelligence (processing speed) was assessed by means of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), a subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III;  ). Older adults obtained lower DSST raw scores than younger adults,   t  (32) = 5.53,   p  <0.001, in line with other cognitive aging studies (e.g.,  ). The groups did not differ from each other, when compared with norms appropriate to the participants' age group,   t  (32) = 1.09,   p   = 0.286. Crystallized intelligence (verbal knowledge) was assessed by means of the Spot-the-Word Test (SWT;  ). In accordance with Park et al.  , no age-related differences were found, both   t  ≤0.46,   p  ≥0.648. \n\nWith respect to the action sequences used in the experiment, all participants confirmed that they were well able to perform the movement exercises. In addition, 10 of the 34 participants were highly experienced in figure skating (six younger adults and four older adults). The six younger figure skaters (5 women,   M =   21.2,   SD   = 2.23, range 18–24 years) spent on average 11.7 hours per week (  SD   = 7.06) on ice for 14.8 years (  SD   = 2.64). The four older figure skaters (3 women,   M   = 56.0,   SD   = 5.60, range 51–64 years) still performed the sport on a regular basis with 3.50 hours per week (  SD   = 1.29) on ice for 35.0 years (  SD   = 22.4). Two of them pursued a professional career for a period of 14.0 years (  SD   = 6.69) with 14.8 hours per week (  SD   = 7.41) on ice but ended it around the age of 22.7 years (  SD   = 11.0). Characteristics of the sample divided by expertise group can be found in  . \n\n\n### Stimuli and design \n  \nThe same video stimuli were used as in the behavioral experiment reported in Diersch et al.  . Half of the videos featured classical figure skating elements (e.g., jumps, spins, and step sequences), all of which are listed in the official judging system for single skating specified by the International Skating Union (ISU,  ). The second set of videos featured simple movement exercises (e.g., running sequences, simple jumps, and spins) that were related to the figure skating sequences as much as possible (e.g., involving rotations) but should be feasible for nearly everyone. Each action was performed by a young male and female athlete (figure skating elements) or non-athlete (movement exercises). The two sets of action sequences were carefully matched with respect to viewing perspective, camera settings, and luminance. The figure skating sequences lasted 11.7 s on average (  SD   = 3.70 s, range 7.40–22.2 s) and the movements exercise sequences 9.00 s on average (  SD   = 0.81 s, range 8.00–10.9 s). In total, 48 different videos consisting of 12 different action sequences from two action categories that were performed by two actors were used in the fMRI experiment. \n\nEach video started with a fixation cross (1000 ms), followed by the beginning of an action sequence. Each action sequence was occluded once for 1000 ms by a grey rectangle at critical time points, for example, when the athlete reached the highest point during the jump. Before each occlusion, the figure skating sequences were visible for 6.24 s (  SD   = 2.54 s, range 3.92–12.4 s) and the movement exercise sequences for 4.50 s (  SD   = 0.76 s, range 3.08–5.92 s) on average,   t  (46) = 3.23,   p   = 0.003. Although the figure skating sequences were visible slightly longer than the movement exercise sequences before they were occluded, there is no reason to assume that this might have influenced the predictive processes in the observers during occlusion. Parkinson et al.   recently showed that the prediction of partly occluded actions is nearly unaffected by the length of the action sequences presented before occlusion suggesting that observers engage in prediction very quickly and automatically, even when only a small fraction of human motion is visible. In addition, the critical time frame during which participants were assumed to engage in the internally guided prediction was kept constant across the two action categories (i.e., the duration of occlusion). \n\nAfter an occlusion, the action sequences continued immediately. The continuations after occlusion were either congruent or incongruent (i.e., 600 ms too early or too late, see   for an example from each action category). Based on the results of the previous behavioral study, in which incongruent continuations of ±400 ms and ±800 ms were used and the prediction sensitivity of the different groups (i.e., response slopes) was analyzed, a temporal shift of ±600 ms was chosen to examine age-related differences in the neural representation of the different action sequences at an intermediate level of difficulty (cf.,  ). \n   Details of experimental conditions during fMRI scanning.  \nDifferent action sequences of classical figure skating elements (A) and simple movement exercises (B) were presented. Each video clip started with a fixation cross (1000 ms), followed by the beginning of an action sequence. Then the occluder was presented for 1000 ms, followed by the continuation of the action, that was either congruent or incongruent (±600 ms). \n  \nThe action sequences were presented in full color with a resolution of 1024×768 pixels and a frame rate of 25 frames per second using a back projection system in which a LCD projection on a screen in the back of the scanner was reflected by a mirror placed above the participants' eyes. The software “Presentation” (Neurobehavioral Systems, Albany, CA) was used to control stimulus presentation and behavioral data collection. \n\n\n### Task and procedure \n  \nFor MRI scanning, participants were provided with ear-plugs and headphones to reduce scanner noise. Vision was corrected with MRI-compatible plastic goggles, if necessary. The participants' task was to judge for each observed action sequence whether the continuation after occlusion was correct or not by pressing on one of two response keys (left key: correct, right key: incorrect) with their index and middle finger on a response device that was placed in their right hand. Participants were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible as soon as the action sequence continued after occlusion. An event-related design was used to measure neural responses during the prediction of observed action sequences. \n\nPrior to the functional run, participants completed a short familiarization and training phase in the scanner during the acquisition of initial control sequences. This allowed them to accommodate to the task and the scanner environment. The familiarization started with two action sequences from each action category that were presented without occlusion and two action sequences from each action category that were presented with occlusion. These action sequences (four different action sequences from each action category) were also presented in a subsequent training phase, in which participants were required to perform the prediction task and received feedback of their performance. The training phase consisted of 16 trials per action category (32 in total). The remaining eight action sequences from each action category that were used in the actual test phase were presented once without occlusion before the functional run started. \n\nThe functional run, in which no feedback was given, consisted of 80 trials (8 action sequences×2 actors×5 repetitions) per action category (160 in total), in which the congruent and incongruent continuations were presented 40 times each. The action sequences were presented in blocks consisting of eight videos from one action category, in which no action was repeated after one another, resulting in 10 blocks from each category (20 in total). The continuations after occlusion were randomized separately with the restriction that the same continuation should not be presented more than two times in a row with a maximum of three congruent or incongruent continuations after one another. Within each action category, the congruent continuation was presented twice as often as the two incongruent continuations (i.e., too early and too late), which resulted in an equal number of congruent and incongruent continuations. The order of the videos and continuations was counterbalanced across participants. After each video block, a resting baseline showing a black screen with a grey fixation cross was presented for 8–12 s, pseudo-logarithmically distributed. The functional run lasted approximately 32 min. \n\nScanning was performed on a 3T TIM Trio scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel head array coil. Functional images were acquired with a gradient echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence with TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, and acquisition bandwidth = 1815 Hz/pixel. The matrix acquired was 64×64 voxels with a FoV of 192 mm×192 mm, resulting in an in-plane resolution of 3 mm×3 mm. Twenty-six axial slices allowing for full-brain coverage were acquired in ascending order with slice thickness = 4 mm and interslice gap = 1 mm. Slices were oriented parallel to the bicommisural plane (AC-PC). A set of 1020 functional images was collected in a single functional run. In addition to functional imaging, high-resolution anatomical images were acquired using a T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence with selective water excitation and linear phase encoding  . Anatomical scanning was performed using a sagittal slice orientation with the following imaging parameters: TI = 650 ms, TR = 1300 ms, TE = 3.5 ms, flip angle = 10°, acquisition bandwidth = 190 Hz/pixel, image matrix = 256×240 voxels, FoV = 240 mm×256 mm, spatial resolution = 1 mm×1 mm×1 mm, 2 acquisitions. All MR datasets obtained in the present study are stored in anonymized form in a database of the MPI for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig. \n\n\n### Data analysis \n  \nData analysis was performed using the SPM8 software package (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) with Matlab 7 (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Preprocessing of the EPI volumes included correction for motion and distortion, slice timing, as well as normalization to the standard MNI space using the unified segmentation approach  . Finally, spatial smoothing was done using an 8 mm full-width at half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel. A two-level random effects approach as implemented in SPM8 was used for the statistical analyses. On the individual level, observed action category as a function of continuation after occlusion was modeled for each participant as separate events convolved with the standard hemodynamic response function: figure skating sequences that continued congruently, figure skating sequences that continued incongruently, movement exercise sequences that continued congruently, and movement exercise sequences that continued incongruently. This resulted in an equal number of relevant events in each condition. \n\nThe respective beginning of occlusion was defined as the target event in order to capture the time in which participants were assumed to engage in the internally guided prediction of the occluded action sequences. The results of our previous study suggested that the sensitivity in action prediction is lower in older adults compared to younger adults and in non-experts compared to experts as evidenced by a larger temporal range during which the continuations after occlusion were predominantly perceived as being just-in-time (i.e., resulting in higher error rates;  ). In the present study, we aimed to examine the neural effects of aging and sensorimotor experience during action prediction that might accompany these differences in behavioral efficiency. Thus, both correct and incorrect trials from each critical condition were incorporated in the fMRI analyses, which also ensured that the same number of events would be included in the analyses of the between-subject effects. In addition, given that neuroimaging data and behavioral data may both be considered as effects of an underlying functional difference (i.e., aging), excluding incorrect responses from the fMRI analysis might also remove age-related differences at the neural level (cf.,  ). The time of the button press was modeled as additional event to control for the effects of finger movements. Each baseline condition was modeled as a boxcar with the respective duration. Confounding factors from head movement, that is, six rotational and translational parameters from the rigid body transformation, obtained during image realignment, were included in the model as covariates of no interest. A high-pass filter at 1/100 Hz was used to remove low-frequency fluctuations of the MR signal. Whole brain analyses were conducted using a voxel-wise threshold of   p  <0.001 and a minimum cluster size of 10 voxels. To control for false positive results, analyses focus on brain regions reaching a cluster-corrected significance threshold of   p  <0.05 (FWE corrected). \n\nOn the first level, the effects of each action category, collapsed across the continuations after occlusion, were compared to baseline and directly to each other, as were the interactions with continuation after occlusion by computing contrast images combining the parameter estimates of the corresponding experimental conditions. On the second level, those contrast images were fed into one-sample   t  -tests to perform inference statistics across the whole sample. Between-subject effects were tested using the general linear model as implemented in SPM. Due to the small sample size of figure skating experts in the two age-groups, two-sample   t  -tests instead of a full factorial design were used to examine the effects of age while correcting for non-sphericity through assuming measurement independence und unequal variance between groups. More specifically, differences between older and younger adults on the respective first-level comparisons were examined while taking experience in figure skating as a covariate of no interest into account. In addition, differences between figure skating experts and non-experts were tested accordingly while including age group as covariate of no interest. Although this did not allow for a direct investigation of interactions between age and experience in figure skating, the effects of motor familiarity were examined as a function of observed action category given that all of the participants were highly experienced with respect to the observed movement exercises. Significant group differences were further examined separately within the respective groups by means of one-sample   t  -tests of the individual contrast images. Anatomical localization of all activations was aided by the Anatomy Toolbox in SPM8   in combination with the Atlas of the Human Brain  . \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nPrediction performance was calculated as proportion of correct responses of every group on congruent and incongruent continuations for each action category with an equal number of trials for each condition. The proportion of correct responses was submitted into an ANOVA with action category (figure skating elements, movement exercises) and continuation after occlusion (congruent, incongruent) as repeated measures variables and age group (younger adults, older adults) and expertise group (figure skating experts, non-experts) as between-subject variables. The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of continuation after occlusion,   F  (1,30) = 11.1,   p   = 0.002, η  = 0.271, and a significant main effect of age group,   F  (1,30) = 18.8,   p  <0.001, η  = 0.385. This was modulated by a significant interaction between continuation after occlusion and age group,   F  (1,30) = 4.99,   p   = 0.033, η  = 0.143. The performance of the groups did not differ significantly when the actions continued congruently (younger adults:   M   = 67.6%,   SD   = 13.0%; older adults:   M   = 61.7%,   SD   = 17.6%),   t  (32) = 1.12,   p   = 0.271. On incongruent continuations, however, the performance of older adults (  M   = 43.0%,   SD   = 11.1%) was significantly lower than the performance of younger adults (  M   = 62.4%,   SD   = 9.96%),   t  (32) = 5.36,   p  <0.001. Prediction performance of the two age groups did differ significantly from chance level for both types of continuation after occlusion, all   t  ≥2.45,   p  ≤.028. In addition, a significant main effect of expertise group was found,   F  (1,30) = 4.90,   p   = 0.035, η  = 0.140, which was modulated by a significant interaction between action category, age group, and expertise group,   F  (1,30) = 8.04,   p   = 0.008, η  = 0.211, as well as a significant interaction between action category, continuation after occlusion, age group, and expertise group,   F  (1,30) = 4.26,   p   = 0.048, η  = 0.124. This implies that the performance of the groups differed as a function of observed action category and continuation after occlusion. \n\nTo further examine these interactions, follow-up ANOVAs with continuation after occlusion (congruent, incongruent) as repeated measures variable and age group (younger adults, older adults) and expertise group (figure skating experts, non-experts) as between-subject variables were conducted for each action category separately. For the figure skating elements, a significant main effect of continuation after occlusion,   F  (1,30) = 8.32,   p   = 0.007, η  = 0.217, confirmed that performance was better for congruent (  M   = 65.0%,   SD   = 18.3%) than incongruent continuations (  M   = 53.3%,   SD   = 16.3%). In addition, a significant main effect of age group,   F  (1,30) = 18.5,   p  <0.001, η  = 0.382, and a main effect of expertise group,   F  (1,30) = 4.54,   p   = 0.041, η  = 0.132, was found. Thus, not only young age (younger adults:   M   = 65.3%,   SD   = 12.3%; older adults:   M   = 51.4%,   SD   = 7.70%) but also experience in figure skating (experts:   M   = 66.0%,   SD   = 16.9%; non-experts:   M   = 56.3%,   SD   = 9.21%) had a positive effect on prediction accuracy during the observation of figure skating elements. \n\nThe follow-up ANOVA for the movement exercises also showed a significant main effect of continuation after occlusion,   F  (1,30) = 11.2,   p   = 0.002, η  = 0.272, and a significant main effect of age group,   F  (1,30) = 11.1,   p   = 0.002, η  = 0.270. As in the overall analysis, this was modulated by a significant interaction between continuation after occlusion and age group,   F  (1,30) = 6.17,   p   = 0.019, η  = 0.170. Older (  M   = 63.6%,   SD   = 18.3%) and younger adults (  M   = 66.0%,   SD   = 11.0%) did not differ significantly in their performance on congruent continuations,   t  (32) = .46,   p   = 0.648. On incongruent continuations, older adults' performance dropped significantly (  M   = 42.9%,   SD   = 12.8%) compared to younger adults (  M   = 63.3%,   SD   = 8.80%),   t  (32) = 5.51,   p  <0.001. \n\nThe results show that older adults predicted the observed action sequences less precisely compared to younger adults, even when they were familiar with the observed actions. They incorrectly perceived incongruent continuations predominantly as still being congruent, which is in line with the results of our previous study suggesting that the temporal sensitivity in action prediction declines with age (cf.,  ). Moreover, sensorimotor experience in figure skating exerted a positive influence on the performance of experts compared to non-experts of the same age group during the observation of the figure skating elements. Together, the behavioral data suggest that all groups attended to the action sequences and engaged in action prediction in the manner that was hypothesized during fMRI scanning. \n\n\n### Neuroimaging results \n  \n#### Effects of predicted action category \n  \nThe prediction of both types of action sequences compared to baseline resulted in bilateral activity in frontal, parietal, occipitotemporal, and occipital regions as well as in some subcortical structures (  and  ). The direct comparison between the action categories revealed remarkable differences. Compared to movement exercises, the visual cortex and the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were more engaged during the prediction of figure skating elements (  and  ). In contrast, the premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal regions of the AON were preferentially activated during the prediction of movement exercises compared to figure skating elements (  and  ). For the movement exercises only, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) differentiated between incongruent and congruent continuations after occlusion ( ). Thus, different regions of the AON showed selectivity for the generally familiar movement exercises whereas visual and frontal areas responded stronger to the less familiar figure skating elements. \n   Main effects of observed action category collapsed across the whole sample.  \nBrain regions that showed greater activation during the prediction of figure skating elements (A) and movement exercises (B) compared to baseline, and direct comparisons between the action categories (C and D).

Compared to younger adults, older adults showed a greater recruitment of the prestriate and extrastriate visual cortex, bilaterally centered in the cuneus, for the figure skating elements as well as the movement exercises compared to the baseline condition (  and  ). During the prediction of movement exercises, older adults engaged an additional region in the right posterior hippocampus extending to the right caudate more than younger adults (  and  ). The reverse contrasts did not reveal any significant clusters that were more activated in younger adults compared to older adults. This confirms that older adults recruited areas beyond the AON, which younger adults did not, during action prediction. \n   Brain regions more activated in older adults compared to younger adults.  \nPatterns of brain activation during the prediction of figure skating elements (A) and movement exercises (B) compared to baseline.

To examine this interaction further, a comparison between both types of action sequences was conducted within each age group. The results are illustrated in the upper panels of   and a complete listing of suprathreshold activations in each age group can be found in  . This analysis revealed that the interaction was due to the younger adults, who showed a greater recruitment of the visual cortex that extended to the PCC and the thalamostriatal network during the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. In older adults, the same comparison revealed only the visual cortex and the medial OFC. In contrast, premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal regions of the AON that were largely confined to the right hemisphere were more activated in younger adults when they predicted movement exercises compared to figure skating elements. In older adults, similar regions were found for the same contrast, although mainly bilaterally distributed.

Experts and non-experts did not differ significantly from each other for both types of action sequences compared to baseline. Interestingly, a significant interaction between predicted action category and expertise group was found again in the left caudate and the left thalamus (  and  ). \n   Interaction between predicted action category and expertise group.  \nBrain regions that showed greater activation in figure skating experts (left panels) and non-experts (right panels) during the prediction of figure skating elements compared to movement exercises (A) and vice versa (B).

A complete listing of suprathreshold activations in each expertise group is provided in  . This analysis revealed that the interaction was due to the figure skating experts, who engaged the bilateral caudate and thalamus together with the early visual cortex more during the prediction of figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. The non-experts, in contrast, showed a greater recruitment of the whole visual cortex and the superior frontal gyrus for this comparison. The reverse contrast did not reveal any suprathreshold activations in experts whereas non-experts engaged premotor, parietal and occipitotemporal regions of the AON during the prediction of movement exercises compared to figure skating elements. No expertise-related activation differences that reached cluster-corrected significance were found for the interactions between action category and continuation after occlusion. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe present study aimed to identify age-related differences in neural activation patterns during the prediction of action sequences that varied in their degree of motor familiarity (i.e., classical figure skating elements and simple movement exercises). Further, the possible role and consequences of neural scaffolding in older adults during action prediction was explored through the inclusion of observers who differed in their degree of sensorimotor experience with the observed actions. In addition, we aimed to clarify the link between AON activity and motor familiarity during action prediction in general. With respect to the AON, our results show that activity in different regions of this network was modulated by sensorimotor experience with the observed actions. Whereas the sensorimotor and occipitotemporal cortices that compose the AON showed more activation for the generally more familiar movement exercises, the prediction of figure skating elements resulted in increased engagement of the visual cortex and the medial OFC. Compared to younger adults, older adults recruited visual regions while performing the prediction task. Older adults also showed greater recruitment of the hippocampus and caudate when predicting actions that were familiar to them. During prediction of the figure skating elements, the caudate together with the thalamus seemed to play an important role in younger observers. In addition, our data indicate that this might have been similarly the case in observers who possessed sensorimotor experience in figure skating. However, due to the small sample size of the figure skating experts in particular, the interpretation of these findings has to be taken with caution. Each of these results and their implications will be considered in turn. \n\n### Modulation of AON activity as a function of predicted action category \n  \nThe prediction of both types of action sequences was accompanied by robust AON activation compared to baseline, in line with many others studies showing that this network is involved in the anticipation of observed actions (e.g.,  – ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nThe direct comparison between the different action sequences revealed that AON activation was increased for the movement exercises, which is in accordance with other studies that found enhanced activity in these regions for familiar actions compared to actions that are not in motor repertoire of the observer (e.g.,  ,  ,  – ). However, the precise relation between level of familiarity and level of activation in the AON is still a matter of debate because some studies also demonstrated decreased AON activity for familiar compared to unfamiliar actions (e.g.,  – ). To reconcile such seemingly discrepant findings, Cross et al.   have proposed a nonlinear relationship between motor familiarity in the observer and AON activity that follows a u-shaped function. According to this model, highly unfamiliar actions produce a greater prediction error than actions of intermediate familiarity. This greater prediction error results in increased AON activity due to increased processing demands between the different regions of the AON. In contrast, highly familiar actions might also lead to enhanced AON activity compared to actions of intermediate familiarity, but for a different reason. Here, participants have generated extremely exact predictions due to a high degree of motor expertise. Any small deviations from such precise predictions might amplify the response within the AON if the sensory input does not exactly match the predicted consequences. \n\nAccording to this proposal, here we might have expected increased AON activity for the less familiar figure skating elements in comparison to the generally familiar movement exercises. These discrepancies in the present as well as across previous studies might be related to the respective definition of unfamiliar actions. For example, unfamiliar actions might be defined as those that are not regularly seen, but are generally executable by the observer, such as unusual hand gestures. They might be also defined as not in the motor repertoire of the observer at all, such as figure skating elements for observers who have never ice skated before. In addition, for movement exercises, only one region of the AON, the pSTS, showed stronger activity when observing incongruent compared to congruent continuations after occlusion. Such a finding is in line with evidence that the STS is involved in the perception of biological motion and contains cells with predictive properties that are sensitive to movements that deviate from expectations  ,  . One should also note that this activation was close to a occipitotemporal region previously identified as the extrastriate body area (EBA;  ). The EBA has been implicated in the evaluation of biomechanical constraints in visual body processing in action-related contexts (e.g.,  ,  ). In addition, higher activity in this region was found in experts compared to non-experts during action prediction  . This suggests that regions within but also beyond the AON might be involved in action prediction depending on the characteristics of the observed actions and the observers' level of motor familiarity. We therefore propose an adaptation to the model put forth by Cross et al.   that also considers unfamiliar actions that the observer cannot reproduce without extensive training in comparison to unfamiliar actions for which the observed kinematics might be inferable and at least to some extent reproducible (see  ). \n   Adapted model of the hypothesized relationship between motor familiarity and activity in the AON.    \nWithin this adapted model, a match between observed and predicted representation of highly familiar actions should be associated with a small prediction error and, thus, intermediate AON activity. Less familiar actions might result in higher AON activity due to a less precise prediction of them that needs to be constantly updated based on the actual sensory input to minimize a larger prediction error. The use of these predictive representations might become less efficient the less familiar an observed action is, until an internal action representation will not be present at all. In these cases, the observed actions might be represented in a rather multimodal way that is supported by the recruitment of regions beyond the classical AON (cf.,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nIn line with this, our data show that the less familiar figure skating elements were processed more in the visual cortex and in the medial OFC, a region that is known to be involved in adaptive decision making in unpredictable situations  ,  . Although special care was taken to match both types of action sequences as much as possible in terms of involved body kinematics, the figure skating elements were executed at a considerably faster speed than the movement exercises. This might have skewed the perceptual complexity and in turn biased the demands on the predictive processes in the observer to some extent. However, the activation in the medial OFC implies that differences in low-level visual features might only partially explain the observed differences in neural activity. This assumption is further supported by the observed group differences in the present study that are discussed below. In addition, given that the action sequences in the present study fulfilled a rather dichotomous criterion with respect to motor familiarity (i.e., either generally familiar or highly unfamiliar actions), further research is clearly warranted that tests the implications of the proposed model more directly. For example, including actions from a continuous range of familiarity would be useful in order to gain a better understanding of how individual differences in motor (and/or visual) familiarity may modulate predictive processing during action observation (see also   for another variation of familiarity). Although beyond the scope of this study, the precise level of AON involvement most likely depends on the specific task demands as well. For instance, whether an action is just passively observed or whether the observer intents to infer its meaning or predicts its time course poses important differences in the neural processing demands in the observer (cf.,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Action prediction in the aging brain \n  \nWith respect to the AON in particular, we did not find age-related activation differences that reached cluster-corrected significance as in Nedelko et al.  . However, the comparison between the action categories within each age group indicated that AON activity was mainly right lateralized in younger adults and bilaterally active in older adults during the prediction of movement exercises compared to figure skating elements. This pattern of activity change has been observed frequently in different cognitive domains and is referred to as hemispheric asymmetry reduction in old adults (HAROLD), suggesting that cortical recruitment under similar conditions tends to be less lateralized in older adults  . \n\nThe results further show that older adults recruited regions beyond the AON, which younger adults did not, while performing the task. No matter what type of action sequence was observed, when comparing to the baseline condition, older adults showed greater recruitment of prestriate and extrastriate visual cortex compared to younger adults. In younger adults, these early visual areas, such as V2, have been shown to be recruited in mental imagery tasks that require the anticipation of objects or scenes that one is about to perceive  . In older adults, however, evidence suggests that the neural representation of sensory input becomes less distinct with age, arguing for an age-related neural dedifferentiation in relevant areas  ,  . In line with this assumption, behavioral evidence suggests that the correlation between sensory and cognitive abilities increases with age  . The increased activation in the visual cortex might therefore partly reflect less specific sensory representations of the observed actions among older adults. These less distinct sensory representations might have been matched with motor representations that also get less selective with age (cf.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ). \n\nHowever, when examined separately, the non-experts in figure skating also demonstrated greater recruitment of a large cluster in the visual cortex during prediction of figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. In addition, Olsson et al.   and Wright et al.   found higher activation in very similar visual areas in non-experts compared to experts during action imagery and observation. This implies that the engagement of visual regions in older adults cannot be solely explained by neural dedifferentiation in the aging mind. The findings rather suggest that the brain's response to challenges that are due to aging or the exposure to unfamiliar material may indeed be similar during the prediction of others' actions (cf.,  ). \n\nOlder adults showed additional activation within the medial OFC during the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to movement exercises. The OFC has been shown to play an important role in the top-down modulation of visual processing through the generation of initial predictions about likely interpretations of the visual input in younger adults  . In their fMRI study on expert-novice differences during the prediction of basketball throws, Abreu et al.   recently found that orbito-frontal regions are specifically linked to correct action prediction in observers who are not familiar with the shown actions. Thus, one might speculate that also the older adults of the present study relied more on these higher-order regions that are involved in adaptive decision-making during the prediction of actions that were less familiar to them. \n\nFor the movement exercises, compared to younger adults, older adults recruited an additional cluster in the right hippocampus extending to the caudate compared to baseline. Neurobiological evidence suggests that these regions form a functional network that is involved in flexible decision-making with the hippocampus generating predictive (spatial) representations and the caudate learning and anticipating action-outcome contingencies (e.g.,  ,  ). In addition, hippocampal activation has been found during episodic imagination of the future that is based on a recombination of past episodic events  ,  . Recent evidence suggests that this functional differentiation, with the hippocampus mediating explicit/declarative memory and the striatum mediating implicit/procedural memory, decreases with advancing age  . Thus, if older adults in the present study were familiar with the observed actions, they seemed to use learned action-outcome contingencies as well as multimodal representations of these actions stored in episodic memory to evaluate the sensory input. Age-related declines in neural selectivity in these regions together with a less efficient use of the own sensorimotor system might in turn have resulted in difficulties to recreate the observed action sequences in necessary detail in order to predict their exact time-course. This is further supported by findings that the reconstruction of episodic details comprising past and future events is reduced in older adults, which is linked to activity changes in medial temporal regions  ,  . \n\nTaken together, the data provide evidence for age-related neural scaffolding in relevant areas during action prediction that is modulated by the degree of motor familiarity with the observed actions. Older adults may have relied predominantly on the visual dynamics of the observed actions during the occlusion period instead of effectively exploiting the sensorimotor matching properties of the AON. Even though it was beyond the scope of this study to examine the neural correlates of successful action prediction within the single groups, it may provide important insights on how the process of action prediction is generally implemented in the aging brain. In the present study, neural activity was measured at the beginning of occlusion to capture the time in which participants were assumed to internally predict the occluded action sequences. Their explicit decision about the continuation after occlusion, however, occurred several seconds later. Future research is therefore needed in order to specify how age-related changes at the neural level are associated with declines in behavioral performance and how predictive coding may actually change with advancing age. In the context of predictive coding, it is argued that predictive processing during perception takes place at multiple levels in the cortical hierarchy (cf.,  ,  ,  ). For example, dopamine has recently been implicated in modulating the precision of prediction errors (or uncertainty) at different levels in the sensorimotor hierarchy  . Changes in neurotransmitter systems such as the dopaminergic system have been linked to neural dedifferentiation in older adults  . Thus, one might speculate that the age-related loss in selectivity in sensory representations and/or prior expectations reflects changes in neurotransmitter function in the aging brain resulting in deficiencies in minimizing prediction errors during action prediction. As Park and Reuter-Lorenz   noted, an efficient task performance relies on an efficient neural circuitry. To the extent that the functionality of these specialized networks declines with age and scaffolding takes place, task performance is likely to get less specific as well. One should also note that this relation presumably depends on additional factors, for example, the connectivity between different brain regions or hemispheres (cf.,  ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Involvement of the caudate in action prediction \n  \nDuring the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to movement exercises, a cluster in the caudate extending to the thalamus was more engaged in younger adults compared to older adults. The activation comprised additionally the left PCC for this direction of the contrast. The caudate is connected to various regions in the cerebral cortex, including inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions of the AON  – . Activity in the caudate is typically linked to performance monitoring in ambiguous contexts, possibly via representing and updating the value of future actions (i.e., the reward-prediction error; e.g.,  – ). Interestingly, this reward-related recruitment has been found not only in experiential but also in observational instrumental learning tasks  . Thus, the caudate appears to be an ideal candidate for neural scaffolding in younger adults during action prediction in conditions of higher difficulty (i.e., lower motor familiarity). In line with this, Schiffer and Schubotz   showed that the caudate is involved in prediction errors that are not related to some kind of reward, but violate predictions about which movements should follow after a certain cue in a movement sequence during action observation. The study also reported activation in the PCC for unexpected movement continuations, a region which has been associated with fast visuospatial orientation in unpredictable contexts  . Accordingly, PCC activity among younger adults of the present study might have reflected visuospatial monitoring of the more ambiguous figure skating elements. \n\nOur data further show that in figure skating experts compared to non-experts a very similar cluster in the thalamostriatal network was more activated during the prediction of the figure skating elements compared to the movement exercises. Although there was no main effect of action category in the present behavioral data, the study reported by Diersch et al.  , which used a more fine-grained psychophysical paradigm, showed that the movement exercises were easier to predict than the figure skating elements even for figure skating experts. Due to the small sample size of the experts in the present study, however, this finding needs further confirmation from studies comprising larger sample sizes. The consistency of the results across groups that are in line with previous research still implies that higher prediction errors might not only modulate activity in the AON but also engage the caudate (together with the thalamus), possibly to adjust and optimize less precise predictions that are generated in the AON. As it was demonstrated in the putamen for stimulus-response behaviors, the caudate might similarly modulate information-transfer between visual and motor areas in action-outcome behaviors (cf.,  ). The fact that the caudate was also active together with the hippocampus in older adults during the prediction of the movement exercises emphasizes again its importance during the prediction of actions that are rather ambiguous for the respective observer. Notably, hippocampal activity has been recently linked to the adaptation of stored action representations in younger adults in conditions in which previously encountered action sequences are repeatedly observed in a new, divergent version  . Whether the hippocampus might fulfill a similar role in older adults during the prediction of familiar actions poses an important question for future research in order to examine the role of observational learning in older adults in action-related contexts. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nThe present study has demonstrated that generating predictive representations of observed actions engages a distributed network in the brain, depending on the characteristics of the observer and the type of observed actions. Based on the predictive coding account, a model was outlined that considers AON activity in relation to the level of motor familiarity in the observer. Moreover, the results underline a role of the caudate during action prediction in ambiguous contexts. In older adults, evidence was found for neural dedifferentiation in relevant areas and engagement of additional regions in line with STAC  . Older adults might be considered, metaphorically speaking, as non-experts in previously well-known domains due to internal action representations that become less precise with advancing age. Thus, emphasizing alternative (visual/mnemonic) strategies in training and intervention programs targeted at older adults may provide a promising alternative that supports successful performance in everyday life despite changes in sensorimotor processing. \n\n\n## Supporting Information \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"b00a063c052681aa4a66930c4dd0c93f"},

Brain regions subserving emotion have mostly been studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during emotion provocation procedures in healthy participants. \n  Objective  . To identify neuroanatomical regions associated with spontaneous changes in emotional state over time.   Methods  . Self-rated emotional valence and arousal scores, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured by perfusion MRI, were measured 4 or 8 times spanning at least 2 weeks in each of 21 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). A random-effects SPM analysis, corrected for multiple comparisons, identified significant clusters of contiguous voxels in which rCBF varied with valence or arousal.   Results  . Emotional valence correlated positively with rCBF in several brain regions, including medial globus pallidus, orbital prefrontal cortex (PFC), and white matter near putamen, thalamus, insula, and medial PFC. Valence correlated negatively with rCBF in striatum, subgenual cingulate cortex, ventrolateral PFC, and precuneus—posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Arousal correlated positively with rCBF in clusters including claustrum-thalamus-ventral striatum and inferior parietal lobule and correlated negatively in clusters including posterior insula—mediodorsal thalamus and midbrain.   Conclusion  . This study demonstrates that the temporal stability of perfusion MRI allows within-subject investigations of spontaneous fluctuations in mental state, such as mood, over relatively long-time intervals. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## 1. Background \n  \nEven though Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease defined by motor features [ ], psychiatric sequelae are common such as depression, anxiety, and apathy [ ,  ]. Previous studies have shown alteration of emotional processing in PD including reduced emotional physiologic response [ ], impaired emotional word recognition [ ], and impaired arousal judgment but normal valence [ ]. The bulk of the evidence suggests that these changes result primarily from the degenerative process in the brain, and are not merely psychological reactions to disability [ ]. Pathologically, Braak and Del Tredici [ ] found that in PD clinical stages 1–3 (stage 4-5 pathologically), neurodegeneration could be seen in almost all areas of the brain including prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic system. Brain areas affected by PD that are hypothesized to cause emotional dysfunction including raphe nuclei, locus ceruleus, amygdala, mesolimbic, mesocortical, mesothalamic dopaminergic systems, and cingulate cortex [ ]. Furthermore, neuroimaging studies have shown that a decrease in dopamine transporter availability in left putamen was associated with a reduction of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex activity during emotional gesture recognition tasks [ ]. Lack of amygdala activation was observed by visual event-related potentials (ERPs) during facial expression recognition [ ]. Based on these data, emotional processing in PD may differ from that of healthy controls.  \n\nMost fMRI experiments on emotional processing used a variety of validated affective stimuli to elicit changes in mood; stimuli included pictures [ ], sounds [ ], and words [ ]. These studies have identified various brain regions involved in the emotional responses to these stimuli, depending partly upon the type of stimulus [ ,  ]. However, studies designed in this manner may identify brain regions involved in affective perception or naming rather than those that produce internal emotional states. Alternatively, the emotional states transiently induced by these artificial stimuli may be pale shadows of the emotional states people experience in response to spontaneous thoughts, real-life events, idiopathic mood disorders, or the cellular and pharmacological pathology of PD.  \n\nWe studied self-rated emotional valence and arousal in patients with PD on several occasions per subject, without attempting to induce specific emotional states. These patients were participating in a pharmacological perfusion MRI study of an adenosine A2a receptor antagonist and the dopamine precursor levodopa, but emotional ratings were obtained in the same drug and placebo conditions in each subject, allowing us to separate the effects of drug from spontaneous variance in emotional state across participants. The objective was to describe brain areas associated with naturalistic emotional state in PD. We hypothesized that spontaneous variation in self-rated emotional state would be accompanied by statistically significant changes in brain activity, as indexed by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) measured with perfusion MRI. \n\n\n## 2. Materials and Methods \n  \nThese data were collected during the course of a Phase IIa clinical and brain imaging study of the investigational adenosine A2a receptor antagonist SYN115, and the primary analyses of those data are reported elsewhere [ ,  ]. The results presented here have not been previously reported except in abstract form [ ]. \n\n### 2.1. Regulatory Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents \n  \nThis study was approved by the Washington University Human Research Protection Office. Written documentation of informed consent was obtained in advance from each subject. Levodopa and SYN115 were given under US FDA Investigational New Drug application (IND) number 78,230. \n\n\n### 2.2. Study Participants \n  \nFurther details appear in Black et al. [ ]. Briefly, 21 patients with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1–3) on a stable dose of levodopa for 30 days were studied. Exclusion criteria included cognitive impairment indicated either by MMSE score <23 or estimated premorbid IQ <70 [ ,  ], neurological diseases other than PD, self-reported history of psychosis or mania, current depression indicated by Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form [ ] score >7, or current use of a dopamine agonist. All were Caucasian and right-handed, and 13 were male. Mean age was 60.8 years (range 44–73 years), mean duration of PD symptoms was 5.3 years (range 0.9–10.8 years), mean “off” UPDRS (placebo day, before levodopa) was 22.5 (range 7–51), and half had ever experienced dopa-induced dyskinesias. \n\n\n### 2.3. Study Protocol \n  \nParticipants were randomly assigned either (a) to take SYN115 twice daily for a week, wait 1 week (washout period), then take a matching placebo twice daily for a week, or (b) the reverse order. For 14 participants, each dose of active drug contained 60 mg of SYN115, whereas 12 subsequent subjects (5 of whom had participated in the 60 mg placebo study) received 20 mg at each dose. Participants and staff were blind to assignment. \n\nOn the last day of each treatment week, participants abstained from food, caffeine, and antiparkinsonian medication overnight, but took the last dose of SYN115 or placebo at 6 am at home. At the imaging center, they took 200 mg carbidopa, and then underwent a set of clinical and MRI assessments. An intravenous levodopa infusion was then begun, dosed in such a way as to rapidly produce and then maintain a steady plasma concentration [ ], with a target concentration of 600 ng/mL. At least 25 minutes after the levodopa infusion started, all MRI and clinical assessments were repeated while the levodopa infusion continued.  \n\nParticipants rated their emotional state in each of four conditions: (1) before and (2) during levodopa infusion (after carbidopa) while taking oral SYN115, and (3) before and (4) during levodopa infusion while taking placebo pills. In each of these 4 conditions, 8 perfusion MRI (CBF) scans were acquired. In 4 of the 8 scans in each condition, the participant fixated on a crosshair throughout the entire 2.73 minutes of each scan; half of these were white on black and half were black on white. In 2 scans, an 8 Hz reversing circular checkerboard pattern surrounded the fixation crosshair, and in 2 scans the participant performed a 2-back letter working memory task for the entire scan. \n\n\n### 2.4. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Scoring of Emotional Valence and Arousal \n  \nThe circumplex model of emotion [ ] describes human emotional states in terms of two independent constructs called valence and arousal (also called valence and “activation,” a term avoided here due to potential confusion with the homonymous word as used in the neuroimaging literature). The original model suggests but does not specify a numerical coordinate system for valence and arousal scores. For this study they were computed as follows. Participants rated various antipodal pairs of emotional descriptors from the circumplex model using VAS [ ] displayed on a computer. They were instructed to freely self-evaluate their current feelings by clicking on the scale for each pair of emotional descriptors. The VAS ratings were recorded on 100 mm scales with anchor terms chosen from the original item set for 4 categories, that is, (a) negative valence, neutral arousal versus positive valence, neutral arousal (sad-happy, grouchy-cheerful); (b) negative valence, high arousal versus positive valence, low arousal (nervous-calm, distressed-relaxed); (c) negative valence, low arousal versus positive valence, high arousal (sluggish-lively, dull-excited); (d) neutral valence, high arousal versus neutral valence, low arousal (intense-tranquil, aroused-passive). For each VAS, the left item anchor was scored as 0 and the right anchor as 100. Subjects were advised to use the full 100 mm VAS range for each item and to score how they felt “at this moment.” Valence and arousal scores were computed from the VAS-item scores by the following formulae: \n  \nvalence score = [average (a, b, c)/50]−1; possible range −1 to +1; \n  \narousal score = 1−[average (b, 100−c, d)/50]; possible range −1 to +1. \n  \n\n### 2.5. MRI Methods \n  \nAll MRI data were acquired on the Siemens 3T Tim Trio with matrix head coil. ASL images were acquired with the commercial Siemens pulsed arterial spin labeling (pASL) sequence [ ]; the center-to-center slice distance was 7.5 mm. Details of image acquisition and transformation to scaled CBF images in atlas space are given elsewhere [ ]. \n\n\n### 2.6. Statistical Analysis \n  \nOnly those voxels were analyzed, that were represented in every EPI image in every subject. Statistical analysis of the CBF data was done via a two-level, random effects model using SPM8 software ( ). First, a voxelwise general linear model (GLM) was computed for each subject. This first-level GLM followed the method of Henson and Penny [ ] by including factors coding for each of the 16 possible combinations of drug (SYN115 or placebo), levodopa (before versus during infusion), and task (the 4 behavioral conditions described in Study Protocol, above). The GLM also included 3 covariates, representing the pertinent valence and arousal scores and their interaction. This approach partitions the variance from each subject's CBF data at a given voxel into components representing valence, arousal, and their interaction, plus components representing the nuisance variables drug, levodopa, task, and all their interactions. The   β   (model coefficient) images from each subject for the valence and arousal covariates became the input data for the final, second-level analysis. \n\nThe second-level (across-subjects) analysis was a voxelwise general linear model (GLM) that tested whether, across subjects, the mean   β   value for valence was significantly greater than zero, after controlling for sex, age, and dose group (60 versus 20 mg SYN115 b.i.d. during the active drug week). A corresponding analysis tested whether mean   β   was significantly   less   than 0. The same analyses were done for arousal. Multiple-comparisons correction was performed at the cluster level with the false discovery rate (FDR) set at   P   = 0.05. Approximate anatomical locations were provided by the Talairach Daemon client ( ) [ ], with corrections by reference to the study-specific MRI template atlas image. \n\n\n\n## 3. Results \n  \n### 3.1. Valence and Arousal, and Their Association with Subject Characteristics \n  \nThe mean value for each VAS item and for the emotional valence and arousal scores are given in   and depicted on a diagram of the circumplex model of emotion ( ). Across conditions, participants tended to have positive valence, mean 0.375 ± 0.339, and low arousal, mean −0.199 ± 0.254 (in other words, they tended to be closer to cheerful and calm than to the opposite). Valence and arousal scores correlated negatively with each other (  r   = −0.31,   P   < .01); that is, subjects who were less aroused (more tranquil) tended also to be happier.  \n\n shows associations of valence and arousal with pharmacological status and demographic variables. SYN115 increased valence (  t  (25) = 2.57,   P   = 0.02) and valence decreased from before to on levodopa (  t  (25) = −2.26,   P   = 0.03), though the mean change in valence score with either drug was less than 5% of the available range. Demographic variables and PD factors were not significantly associated with emotional valence or arousal ( ). \n\n\n### 3.2. Perfusion MRI Data \n  \n#### 3.2.1. Correlations of rCBF with Valence \n  \nRandom-effects analysis revealed significant positive correlations of rCBF with valence across subjects. We found significant areas in prefrontal-subcortical circuits; that is, bilateral dorsolateral PFC, bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (ACCs), orbital frontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus. Other significant clusters were observed in cortical areas including left and right ventral frontotemporal regions, lateral parietal cortex, insula, right motor, and premotor areas (see   and Figures  – . \n\nAreas whose rCBF correlated negatively with valence included a part of ACC, bilateral subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC), along with parts of caudate and putamen, bilateral inferior frontal gyri, bilateral superior parietal lobule (SPL), inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, and PCC (see   and Figures  – ). \n\n\n#### 3.2.2. Correlations of rCBF with Arousal \n  \nRandom-effects analysis of rCBF-arousal correlations found no voxels whose   t   value exceeded our predetermined voxel-level threshold corresponding to uncorrected   P   = 0.001. However, as an exploratory analysis, relaxing that initial threshold to a value corresponding to uncorrected   P   = 0.005 revealed several clusters that were significant after correction for multiple comparisons (  and Figures  - ). \n\n\n#### 3.2.3. Correlations of rCBF with the Interaction of Valence and Arousal \n  \nA random-effects analysis of the valence × arousal interaction found no activated clusters significant at   P   < 0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n\n## 4. Discussion \n  \nThis study found a number of brain regions whose activity increased or decreased with changes in self-rated current mood state. Emotional state ratings, drew on the face validity and experimental history of the circumplex model of emotion [ ], augmented here by a numerical implementation of the valence and arousal constructs. The conservative statistical approach employed for this analysis lends credence to the results and uses general linear modeling to minimize the potential confounds of demographic variation (age and sex) and unrelated experimental manipulations (such as medication status). Additionally, the study design allowed us to study ecologically valid or “real,” that is, spontaneously experienced, internal emotional state, which may more faithfully reflect patients' day-to-day experiences. \n\nOn the other hand, the study has a number of limitations, most of which derive from the fact that correlation of rCBF with current emotional state was not a primary goal of the data collection. Mood ratings were not done within the scanning session itself, but rather within a half hour or so, under broadly similar physiological conditions. This may have added noise to our results, so that we may have failed to detect some true correlations. Second, valence and arousal scores were (inversely) correlated, interpretation of results related to one emotional dimension might also be a result of changes in the other. However, the inclusion in our SPM model of a valence-arousal interaction should help disentangle their relation to rCBF. The correlation also tends to restrict the range of emotional states sampled. For that and perhaps other reasons, the range of emotional states reported by the subjects in our data did not equally sample all quadrants of emotional experience. Specifically, there was a bias of positive over negative valence, and low over high arousal. As a consequence, negative correlations with valence came primarily from data with positive values. Additionally, we cannot comment conclusively on whether regions identified as correlating with self-rated mood in this study are specific to PD, since we did not include healthy control subjects. \n\n### 4.1. Nonimaging Results \n  \nEmotional rating in our participants tended towards positive valence and low arousal ( ,  ). We did not test whether this differed from a control group. However, Drago et al. [ ] show that non-demented PD patients under-rate arousal in others' facial expressions, compared to healthy control subjects, and that their spatial judgments are less affected than controls' by emotional stimuli. Imaging studies have shown decreased activation of emotional regions to emotional faces or gestures [ ]. These findings may correspond to observations that PD patients actually experience lower emotional arousal, along with other manifestations of apathy [ ,  ].  \n\nThe slight improvement in mood with SYN115 is not surprising given that it is an adenosine 2a antagonist (caffeine is a nonspecific adenosine antagonist). The small decrease in valence on levodopa may seem counterintuitive, depression and anxiety commonly attend wearing off of individual levodopa doses in PD [ ]. However, on-levodopa data were always collected a few hours after the off-levodopa data, and if subjects were merely less enthusiastic later in the study day, as one might expect, then valence and arousal would be lower, causing an apparent association with levodopa. \n\nThe lack of correlation of UPDRS with mood ratings may be a Type II error, but is consistent with other data suggesting that, contrary to common expectation, motor impairment is at best a modest predictor of mood state in PD [ ]. \n\n\n### 4.2. Regions Associated with General Emotional Processing \n  \nOur study revealed a number of neural substrates associated with naturalistic emotional state; that is, (a) medial frontal PFC/ACC—subcortical circuit—medial PFC/ACC, basal ganglia, and thalamus; (b) limbic and paralimbic—amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, thalamus, mamillary body, and PCC, insula, parietal, and lateral PFC; (c) visual system—occipital and temporal cortex. These regions are generally in line with previous studies in healthy controls.  \n\nIn a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies of human emotions by Phan et al. [ ,  ], medial frontal PFC (BA 9, 10) was activated in response to nonspecific emotion. In other words, this region was involved in emotional processing regardless of valence, arousal, or induction method. In the present study, we found some brain regions that contained activations associated with either arousal or valence, such as basal ganglia (BG), thalamus, and parietal lobe. Basal ganglia were correlated with happiness induction in 70% of the studies, and disgust induction in 60% [ ] as well as responded to arousal stimuli evidenced by fMRI and skin conductance response (SCR) [ ]. The thalamus is connected to BG, ACC, medial frontal PFC, orbital PFC, and dorsolateral PFC, forming several frontal-subcortical circuits [ ]. The ACC is also closely interconnected to medial PFC. Lesions in the anterior cingulate—subcortical circuit can produce apathy [ ], and the apathy experienced by PD patients who undergo subthalamic (STN)—deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been attributed to dysfunction of medial PFC [ ,  ]. In addition, the thalamus links other structures in the limbic system, which is responsible for fundamental instinctive behaviors, cognition, and emotion, by receiving input from amygdala, basal forebrain, cerebellum, hippocampus, and septal nuclei, and projecting to prefrontal, cingulate, and parietal cortex [ ]. Therefore, the BG, thalamus, and parietal cortex might be related to general emotion processing as a part of this network. \n\n\n### 4.3. Associations between Valence and rCBF \n  \nWe found regions in limbic and paralimbic structures—amygdala, medial PFC/rostral ACC, lateral PFC, and insula—that were positively correlated with valence; whereas subcallosal and posterior cingulate cortex (SCC and PCC) were negatively correlated with valence. \n\n#### 4.3.1. Positive Correlation with Valence \n  \nAmygdala responses to valence or arousal stimuli have varied. Although amygdala response was related to arousal stimuli [ ], and over 60% of studies reported amygdala activation in response to fear induction [ ,  ], other studies have found activation to happy faces [ ] or have linked amygdala activity to both valence and arousal [ ,  ]. Thus, it may respond to salient characteristics of emotion. However, we found amygdala rCBF positively related only to valence. According to the neuropathological staging of PD (stages 1–6) proposed by Braak and colleagues [ ], amygdala dysfunction first appears in presymptomatic stage 3 in a particular region. In addition, dopamine is lost in the amygdala due to degeneration of the ventral tegmental area in PD. In fact, loss of dopaminergic innervation of amygdala and other limbic structures were observed in PD subjects diagnosed with major depression [ ], and dopamine modulates the response of amygdala to fearful stimuli in PD patients with depression [ ].  \n\nThe ACC is known to be involved in a form of attention that serves to regulate both cognitive (dorsal) and emotional (ventral) processings [ ]. Valence perception has been reported to be normal in nondemented and nondepressed PD patients [ ], thus, the activity in medial frontal PFC might reflect activation of circuits involved in valence-related attention or decision making. \n\n\n#### 4.3.2. Negative Correlation with Valence \n  \nSubcallosal cingulate cortex was associated with sadness in about 46% studies [ ], in line with our results. Clinically, patients with more than 3 episodes of untreated MDD had smaller SCC volume than controls [ ,  ], and DBS of SCC may benefit treatment resistant depression [ ]. \n\nPosterior cingulate cortex was also negatively correlated with valence. PCC has been linked to emotional processing and is thought to enhance memory for emotional stimuli [ ]. A study that controlled for nonemotional, memory enhancing stimulus features suggested that this region might mediate interactions of emotional and memory-related processes [ ]. Activity in PCC has also been reported to correlate with severity of anxiety symptoms in major depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder [ ,  ] and was associated with levodopa dose-related mood fluctuations in PD patients [ ]. \n\n\n\n### 4.4. Associations between Arousal and rCBF \n  \nWe adopted a more permissive first-stage threshold to find any regions in which rCBF correlated with emotional arousal. The approach is reasonable, but as this threshold differs from the prespecified methods, the arousal results should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nThe rCBF in hippocampus and middle temporal gyrus correlated positively with arousal in the present study, consistent with the study of Nielen et al. [ ]. The connection with hippocampus may relate to observations that arousal can modulate memory [ ].  \n\nResults from prior studies were arguable whether occipital lobes actually responded to valence or to arousal. The studies of Mourão-Miranda et al. [ ] and Lane et al. [ ] found that visual processing could vary with either valence or arousal, consistent with our findings, in which lingual gyrus was also associated negatively with valence, whereas others found occipital activation only when participants were presented stimuli of negative valence [ ,  ]. The activation of the visual system with emotional valence and arousal may be that both can increase attentional processing. Emotional and attentional processings both involve medial frontal PFC, and a variety of functional neuroimaging studies have suggested that attention modulates activity of extra-striate visual cortex [ ]. Moreover, threat stimuli lead to increased perceptual processing [ ]. Our data might extend prior knowledge that current internal emotion, and not just visually presented emotional stimuli, may enhance visual system activity. \n\n\n\n## 5. Conclusion \n  \nEmotions are usually regarded as brief but intense responses to changes in the environment featuring a number of subcomponents: (a) cognitive appraisal, (b) subjective feeling, (c) physiological response, (d) expression, (e) action tendency, and (f) regulation [ ]. In addition, emotional stimulation can be of an interoceptive or exteroceptive nature. Different methods used to provoke emotional state changes can activate different systems. For example, the recall method activated mostly ACC and insula, whereas amygdala and occipital lobe were activated by visual induction [ ]. \n\nMany neuroimaging studies of emotion in healthy volunteers have used clever methods to transiently stimulate emotional perception or attempt to quickly induce a given emotional state. Some experimental designs were chosen in part due to the limitations of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI, namely, its nonquantitative nature and the marked decline in signal-to-noise ratio of BOLD signal at time intervals greater than a few minutes. \n\nThe use of ASL perfusion fMRI enabled us to study within-subject fluctuations of internal mood states over relatively long periods of time (hours to weeks), a study design that is not possible with BOLD fMRI. Since we studied self-perceived emotional state without intentional provocation of a specific emotion, we could examine the effect of “subjective feeling” while being minimally confounded by other emotional processes. Furthermore, the rated emotion might be as a result of both “interoceptive” and “exteroceptive” natural stimulation that might result in stronger and more regions emotional stimulation, as compared to only one induction method alone. Despite the limitations of this study, it may demonstrate the potential utility of perfusion fMRI in the study of emotion. \n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"9201429c65f6ff26450b75f235d7d5ca"},

Other forms of love such as romantic or maternal attachment have previously been studied from a neuroimaging point of view. Here we aimed to investigate the neural basis of this tribal form of love, which implies both the feeling of belongingness and rivalry against opposing teams. A pool of 56 participants was submitted to an fMRI experimental design involving the presentation of winning and losing football moments of their loved, rival or neutral teams. We found recruitment of amygdala and reward regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN), as well as other limbic regions involved in emotional cognition, for ‘positive   vs   neutral’ and ‘positive   vs   negative’ conditions. The latter contrast was correlated with neuropsychological scores of fanaticism in the amygdala and regions within the reward system, as the VTA and SN. The observation of increased response patterns in critical components of the reward system, in particular for positive content related to the loved team, suggests that this kind of non-romantic love reflects a specific arousal and motivational state, which is biased for emotional learning of positive outcomes. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nRomantic and maternal love represent well-studied forms of passionate experience, with recognized biological and evolutionary relevance. Both imply a dual relationship in the formation of a bound between individuals ( ;  ;  ). Several studies established a coupling between both types of attachment processes and the neural systems underlying the experience of reward. The neural network mediating responses to gratifying stimuli, related to the goals that individuals seek, such as pleasure and motivation, is defined as the reward system. Motivational arousal is largely dependent on dopaminergic modulation ( ;  ). The mesocortical and mesolimbic dopamine systems represent important pathways underlying processing of reward value and motivational function. These pathways stem from dopaminergic cells within the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The mesolimbic dopamine system comprises projections to the nucleus accumbens, but also to the amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex and septum. In the mesocortical dopamine system, medial VTA projects to the medial prefrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus and perirhinal cortex ( ). The nigrostriatal pathway provides modulatory influences from substantia nigra (SN) to caudate nucleus and putamen. Both romantic and maternal love have been shown to recruit these core systems underlying reward processing ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ). \n\nBonding and identification at the larger scale of a group level is very important in a broader social context. Feelings associated with group belongingness represent a sort of non-romantic love. Such feelings of belongingness can indeed be considered to form the core of a basic human need like food, water and shelter and are also deeply rooted in a human evolutionary context ( ). Several studies have demonstrated that loving attachment for in-group members, reflecting the sense of belongingness, is a general phenomenon. It biases empathy, altruistic and helping attitudes among diverse social groups, including race ( ;  ;  ), ethnicity ( ), political affiliation ( ) and even sports team allegiance ( ;  ). For reviews on the neuroscience of in-group biases, please see ( ) and ( ). \n\nA strong example of group identification, feeling of belongingness and loyalty is the passion for a football team, which may therefore be viewed as sort of tribal love. Desmond Morris described in an impactful book this tribal character of the link between, not only football players, coaches and directors, but between the fans and the teams. Football was described as a tribal phenomenon and the author framed in an evolutionary view how the attachment for a preferred football team and nation has achieved such significance for very large audiences ( ). The cognitive neuroscience of fan binding to a team is poorly studied from the neuroimaging point of view. Nevertheless, its social importance is irrefutable and the phenomenon of team love is worth deeper scientific investigation. \n\nThis issue is indeed relevant in the context of social neuroscience, given that sports have overwhelming socioeconomic impact in large communities worldwide. Concerning football, FIFA’s 2014 financial report summarizes revenues of over 2 billion US dollars in that year ( ). In 2015, the amount spent in transfers of football players in the English premier league, reached 870 million pounds ( ). This reflects the enormous amount of time, energy and money that fans spend in their commitment to their beloved teams. This form of passionate behaviour is defined as a strong type of non-romantic love binding the fans to their team and they, as consumers, support the football teams and the leagues, leading to large-scale business models. \n\nDespite the neuroscientific and social relevance of this phenomenon, few studies address its neural underpinnings. The purpose of this work is to study this form of ‘passionate love’. ‘Fanaticism’ is not labelled as a negative term in this context. We rather assess it formally as the intensity of being a fan (as defined by a rating scale), leaving out any negative connotation or any relation to hooliganism or other dysfunctional behaviours. \n\nFootball can nurture a range of emotional feelings and behavioural patterns, which are, consciously or unconsciously, perceived by the supporters as needs. We hypothesize that these needs strongly modulate processing in the brain reward system as a function of the coding of the reward value of this particular social context. Reward processing has been studied using fMRI and PET in the study of hedonic responses to stimuli such as food ( ), drugs ( ) or love ( ;  ;  ). A critical question is whether the passion for a football team engages similar networks as the love for a person. \n\nTo answer this question we implemented a neuroimaging paradigm where participants, with formally defined levels of neuropsychological fanaticism scores, viewed memorable winning and losing football moments where their beloved team competed with rival/neutral teams. We hypothesized that these emotional experiences involve at least part of the same limbic regions that are recruited in other forms of love, and in particular the human reward system. A relevant question was which brain regions are recruited as a function of fanaticism. \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nA pool of 61 football enthusiasts was recruited from the fan support organization of two Portuguese teams:   Futebol Clube do Porto   (henceforward labelled as Porto) and   Associação Académica de Coimbra   (labelled as Académica) as well as citizens that defined themselves as football fans (Porto or Académica supporters), who were evaluated in terms of fanaticism scores. The two teams played in the Portuguese First League at the time of the study, Porto was one of the top ranked teams in the league and Académica ranked at the bottom. \n\nSixty one subjects were recruited, of which 58 completed the scanning session. In total 2 out of 58 were excluded from this part of the study, given that debriefing revealed that they focused only on the technical aspects of the videos (one was a football player and the other person was a coach). In the functional imaging analysis 56 subjects were included (54 males and 2 females, aged from 21 to 60 years, mean age 34.4 ± 10.7 years). Fifty-five out of 56 used the joystick in the right hand given their handedness. All the subjects had normal or corrected to normal vision. All subjects signed the informed consent of this study, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. \n\n\n### Acquisition parameters \n  \nStructural and functional MRI scans were acquired in a 3T Magnetom Trio Tim MRI scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), using a 12-channel head coil. A T1-weighted MPRAGE anatomical volume was measured with repetition time (TR) of 2530 ms, echo time (TE) of 3.42 ms, resolution 1 mm , flip angle of 7°, matrix size 256 × 256, field of view of 256 × 256 and a slice thickness of 1 mm. \n\nConsidering the regions of interest (ROIs) that were relevant for the present study, we were aware of the susceptibility artefact. To correct for this source of noise, we acquired gradient-echo field maps before each Echo Planar Imaging (EPI)-blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) sequence to map the distortions. Phase and magnitude field maps were acquired with the same orientation and the same field of view, TR of 3000 ms, TE of 30 ms, echo spacing 0.5 ms, phase resolution 100%, phase encoding direction from anterior to posterior, TE difference of 2.46 ms and bandwidth in the phase direction of 31.25 Hz. \n\nFunctional data were acquired using EPI sequences, using slice thickness of 3 mm and voxel size 4 mm , 36 slices acquired parallel to the AC–PC line, TR 3000 ms, TE 30 ms, flip angle of 90°, matrix size 256 × 256 and FOV of 256 × 256. In the whole session, two out of four runs were acquired for the study we present here. Both runs had 190 volumes. \n\nThe videos were rendered through a 698.40 × 392.85 mm LCD monitor (NordicNeuroLab, Bergen, Norway) with a frequency rate of 60 Hz, placed ∼156 cm away from the participants’ head. Audio was provided through MR-compatible headphones. The subject could actively select the response using an MR-compatible joystick (Hybridmojo, San Mateo CA, USA). The participant used this device to move the cursor in the screen and pressed the button on its top to select his/her answer. \n\n\n### Task \n  \nParticipants underwent fMRI scans while they were watching short video streams of representative negative or positive goal situations in relation to the loved team or a rival team, or neutral (videos of Italian B-series teams, with high probability of being unknown). \n\nTo guarantee the consistency of visual content, all videos are exclusively rendered within the same framework of goal situations in football, with explicit exclusion of any images of actors such as fans or coaches and their reactions. All the videos presented a very similar scene content (a football field, movement of football players, which were the only actors, scored goals). All videos were resized to the 1280 × 720 aspect ratio. Despite all efforts made to keep the consistency of the visual content, the nature of the visual stimuli precluded an absolute matching in what refers to e.g. brightness or movement content. \n\nThe video collection was tailored to Porto fans and to Académica fans and both included five videos of the favourite team’s winning moments (labelled as +LovedTeam), five videos of winning moments of their favourite team against strong rival teams ( ++LovedTeam), five videos of the favourite team’s losing moments (−LovedTeam), five videos of losing moments of their favourite team against strong rival teams (--LovedTeam), five videos of rival team’s winning moments (+RivalTeam), five videos of rival team’s losing moments (−RivalTeam) and five videos of Italian B-series teams (0Neutral: no fan related or antagonistic content). Henceforward, we will use the abbreviations as used in   to describe the conditions when specifying the contrasts. The blocks of videos were initiated by TR triggers and could last between 6 and 12 s. The average duration of loved team’s positive videos was 8.8 s, while for negative videos was 9.0 s. For the +RivalTeam, −RivalTeam and 0Neutral, the average duration was respectively 9.2, 8.8 and 7.2 seconds. The duration of each video was considered in the creation of the predictor’s model as detailed further in this section.\n   \nAbbreviations and description of videos in each condition and theirs contents \n  \n\nThe participants were asked to classify each video in a - 3 to 3 Likert-like rating scale, right after the video presentation ( ). The participant underwent 2 EPIBOLD runs of 9.5 min each, of 17 and 18 videos, respectively. They contained at least two and up to three trials of each condition per run (overall five trials per condition). In total, 35 videos were presented in a randomized order. \n\n\n### Behavioural data \n  \nBefore the MRI session, the participants answered a questionnaire and completed the Football Supporter Fanaticism Scale (FSFS) ( ) (in Portuguese,   Escala de Fanatismo em Torcedores de   Futebol). This is a self-report scale assessing the level of fanaticism for football. This Likert scale was translated from Brazilian Portuguese to Portugal Portuguese by two experienced psychologists and verified by a third element, and used in a one to five ordinal range. \n\n\n### fMRI data analysis \n  \nGeometrical distortions were calculated based on the pixelshift algorithm and using Gradient field maps as input in the AnatAbacus v1.1 plugin ( ) for BrainVoyager QX to undistort the EPI-BOLD images. \n\nFunctional data were then pre-processed and analysed using BrainVoyager QX 2.8.2 (Brain Innovation, Maastricht, The Netherlands). Data were corrected for: (i) slice scanning time differences using cubic spline interpolation; (ii) for motion, combining trilinear and sinc function based methods for interpolation in the three axes (the second run was corrected in relation to the first volume of the first run); and (iii) filtered in the time domain using a General Linear Model (GLM) approach with Fourier basis set with two cycles per time course. The anatomical and functional data were co-registered (and manually verified) and then normalized according to the Talairach atlas. After the spatial normalization, spatial smoothing was performed using a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHW. A random effects (RFX) analysis was done at the group level using a GLM approach. The predictor’s model was obtained by convolution of the boxcar time course (considering each video duration individually) with a two-gamma haemodynamic response function. A mask was obtained by averaging all functional files, automatically excluding bone and scalp. Eyes and cerebellum were manually extracted from the mask, using the information from the anatomical files. The RFX-GLM statistical maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) ( ) with a fixed   P  -value lower than 0.01. \n\nCorrelation analysis was performed using the same software tool. Beta values, resulting from the RFX-GLM analysis, were correlated with an external covariate (FSFS individual scores). The resulting whole-brain maps containing   r  -values were corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster threshold levels with a p value of 0.006 and voxel extent, which estimation was based on Monte Carlo simulations (1000 iterations). Significant clusters include at least 78 contiguous voxels. \n\nVolumetric segmentation was performed with FreeSurfer 5.3 software which procedure is documented online ( ). The ROIs segmentation was based on an atlas of probabilistic information computed from a manually labelled dataset ( ;  ) based on the Duvernoy atlas ( ). The obtained ROIs of right and left amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, globus pallidus, putamen and thalamus of 10 subjects in native space were then transformed into Talairach space using the transform files created before in BrainVoyager QX 2.8. The resultant files were combined to extract peak voxels from the RFX statistical maps when contiguous clusters overlapped different anatomical regions. \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioural results \n  \nConsidering the subjects that completed the functional study, 2 out of 56 had missing answers in the FSFS scale. Considering the 54 participants with complete assessments, the mean score was 3.19 ± 0.95 (mean ± s.d.,   n   = 54). For this scale, we saw no differences [  t  -test,   t  (52) ≤ 2.01,   P   < 0.14, non-significant] between the sample of Porto fans (FSFS, mean score 3.38 ± 1.07,   n   = 28) and the sample of Académica fans (FSFS, mean score 2.99 ± 0.67,   n   = 26). \n\nConsidering the pool of 56 subjects, video classification (in the Likert −3 to 3 scale) yielded the following results (condition mean ± s.d.): +LovedTeam 2.61 ± 0.53;  ++LovedTeam 2.62 ± 0.61; −LovedTeam −1.81 ± 1.14; --LovedTeam −2.27 ± 1.14; +RivalTeam −1.01 ± 1.27; -RivalTeam 0.87 ± 1.27; 0Neutral −0.04 ± 0.94. The negative videos (−LovedTeam and --LovedTeam) resulted in different response levels, as revealed by a paired   t  -test   t  (55) = 5.1,   P   < 0.00001. However, the responses in the scale revealed that +LovedTeam and  ++LovedTeam conditions were quite similar, as revealed by a paired   t  -test   t  (55) = −0.17,   P   = 0.859, ns. \n\n\n### General random effects analysis \n  \nWe performed whole-brain group level RFX-GLM analysis [  t  (55) = 3.59,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected] related to the visualization of positive and negative videos. The overall contrast of ‘positive   vs   negative’ moments ( ++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs  . --LovedTeam and −LovedTeam) revealed increased activity bilaterally in the inferior temporal lobe, amygdala, hippocampus, insula, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, VTA, SN and right caudate. This contrast also showed more activation in the left lingual gyrus and right inferior parietal lobule. The reverse contrast did not show areas of significant activity. See   and   for a complete overview of these results. \n  \nExperimental design. The paradigm had a box-car design. In the first block, the participants were watching video streams between 6 and 12 s of goal situations. Then they were asked to rate the video −3 to 3 scale Likert-like rating scale. Each pair of video/response was followed by a baseline period which duration was jittered in time (randomly between 9 and 15 s). The video presentation order was randomized. \n  \n  \nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast ‘positive   vs   negative’ \n    \n\nThe contrast of ‘positive   vs   neutral’ moments ( ++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   0Neutral, balanced as [1 1 −2]) showed the involvement of the inferior temporal lobe, right parahippocampus, right hippocampus, amygdala bilaterally, VTA and posterior cingulate. The reverse contrast showed increased activity in the auditory cortex, visual cortex and lingual gyrus [RFX,   t  (55) = 3.73,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected]. Peak voxels are described in   (  provided as  ).\n   \nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast ‘positive   vs   neutral’ \n      \nRegions significantly activated by the predictor contrast ‘negative   vs   neutral’ \n     The contrast of ‘negative vs neutral’ moments [--LovedTeam and -LovedTeam   vs   0Neutral, balanced as (1 1 -2)] evidenced increased activity in middle temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal gyrus. The inverse contrast showed increased activity in the midcingulate, lingual gyrus and auditory cortex [RFX, t(55) =3.57, P < 0.01, FDR corrected]. See details in Table 4 ( ). The contrast of ‘loved team's positive vs rival's negative moments’ (+LovedTeam vs - RivalTeam, considered as directly positive and indirectly positive) showed more activation in the right inferior parietal lobule and right inferior frontal gyrus (See Figure 3 and Table 5). The reverse contrast evidenced increased activity in the left superior frontal gyrus [RFX, t(55)=4.28, P <0.01, FDR corrected]. \n\n\n### Correlation analysis of brain activity patterns and neuropsychological scores \n  \nWe performed a whole brain correlation analysis between beta values across regions and the FSFS individual scores. The correlation between the contrast of ‘positive   vs   negative’ moments ( ++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   --LovedTeam and −LovedTeam) and the FSFS individual scores showed positive correlations in the inferior temporal lobe, amygdala, right insula, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, VTA and SN (  r   > 0.37 with   P   < 0.006, corrected). A negative correlation was found in the angular gyrus (BA 39). See   and   for a complete overview of these results. \n  \nSignificant BOLD activations for the ‘positive   vs   negative’ contrast. Sagittal and transversal slices show the regions activated in the whole-brain RFX-GLM analysis [  t  (55) = 3.59,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected], overall contrasting ++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   –LovedTeam and --LovedTeam conditions. The group results are projected in a single subject’s brain just for visualization purposes. The reverse contrast did not show areas of significant activity. Left = right. Green lines are only present to facilitate localization. \n    \nSignificant BOLD activations for the contrast of ‘loved team’s positive videos   vs   rival team’s negative videos’ (directly positive to the self because of positive affect   vs   indirectly positive to the self because of negative affect of rival fans). Sagittal views to show the regions activated in the whole-brain RFX-GLM analysis [  t  (55) = 4.28,   P   < 0.01, FDR corrected]. \n    \nCorrelation maps which were calculated by contrasting ‘positive   vs   negative’ moments and the fanaticism score. The contrast ++LovedTeam and +LovedTeam   vs   –LovedTeam and --LovedTeam was correlated with the FSFS individual scores in a whole-brain analysis (  r   > 0.37 with   P   < 0.006, corrected). Left = right. Green lines are only present to facilitate localization. \n  \n  \nRegions retrieved from the r-map \n    \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThe aim of this work was to address the neural correlates of passionate attachment to a loved team, a sort of modern tribal love that is dissociable from romantic and maternal love. We found strong recruitment of reward regions including the brain stem, VTA and SN, as well as limbic regions involved in emotional cognition. Using neuropsychological team attachment scales we further found a significant correlation between regions that responded to positive states of team love with individual scores of fanaticism. \n\n### Reward value and love for the preferred competing team \n  \n  Reward system   . We expected that the positive content in the selected stimuli would activate motivational and reward related circuitry, reflecting the value attributed to the team affective attachment. Reward and motivational arousal are dopamine-dependent ( ;  ) which is well in line with the regions identified in our study. The dopamine-reward system, mediates the link between pleasure and motivation, in other words, the affective goals that individuals seek ( ) during emotionally loaded social contexts. \n\nA core network involving the VTA, SN, striatum (caudate, putamen and globus pallidus), insula, hippocampus and amygdala were shown to be activated by the contrast of ‘positive   vs   negative’ valence conditions. These are critical areas of the reward and affective processing systems mediating the perception of reward as well as for learning and processing of social reinforcement. \n\nTwo of the four major dopamine pathways in the brain, the the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways, are particularly involved in motivational processing and receive strong influence from the dopaminergic VTA ( ). \n\nThe VTA, amygdala and hippocampus were all activated with both the contrasts of ‘positive   vs   negative’ and ‘positive   vs   neutral’ videos. These results suggest the engagement of the mesolimbic pathway during the visualization of positive situations involving the loved team. \n\nInterestingly, the cingulate gyrus and perirhinal cortex (included in the temporal clusters) were activated by both contrasts ‘positive   vs   neutral’ and ‘negative   vs   neutral’. This finding may be linked with the postulated suggestion that the mesocortical pathway is involved in reward processing both for conditions entailing positive reward and punishment. Moreover, the medial prefrontal cortex, which has a role in emotion regulation and it is also part of the mesocortical pathway, was activated by the contrast of ‘negative   vs   neutral’ conditions. This finding corroborates the notion that this region is important for cognitive control and appraisal of negative emotions ( ). Overall, these results support the notion that regions within the reward system are strongly involved in the processing of positive and negative valence stimuli in the context of non-romantic ‘tribal’ love for a football team. \n\nDespite the widespread interest in the study of the reward system in the context of social neuroscience, rare neuroimaging studies address the neurobehavioural correlates of sports fanaticism.  ) studied anticipatory pleasure (conditions: goals; missed chances; open play) in nine football supporters. The authors suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in cognitive aspects of pleasure processing, while the putamen was implicated in the anticipation of pleasure. Moreover, Cikara   et al   .   found that the anterior cingulate (and also insula) related to the processing of negative stimuli related to the participants’ favourite team. They studied the neural effects of social group identity in sport (baseball fans) and they found the ventral striatum was strongly modulated by the processing of positive stimuli. Interestingly, this effect was found to be correlated with self-reported desire to aggress against outgroup members.   assessed 23 basketball fans in a study of emotional memory. Before the fMRI session, the fans watched a game with the rival team. Then, while they were scanned, they reviewed short videos which ended in the moment that the ball was released towards the basket. The participants had to recall whether or not the ball went into the basket, as well as the confidence on that answer and the emotional valence of that clip. Results showed that such memory retrieval activated dorsal frontoparietal regions. Memories retrieved with high confidence additionally recruited insula and the medial temporal lobe ( ). These studies did not emphasize the affective and social neuroscientific aspects of team love. \n\n  Tribal (in-group)   vs   individual maternal/partner love bonds.    Neuroimaging studies directly addressing in-group (tribal)   vs   out-group behaviour are also sparse in the literature. Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no previous work studying the neural correlates of in-group non-romantic love in relation to the concept of a strong affective link supporting the tendency to favour the in-group (tribal)   vs   out-group members ( ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The present results are therefore worth discussing within the context of other forms of inter-individual bonding such as maternal and romantic love. \n\nOur results show striking similarities with the neural underpinnings of maternal love and romantic love as described by  ,  ). Activation of the insula, striatum (putamen, caudate and globus pallidus), thalamus, SN/VTA were also found in our study.  ) studied long-term romantic love and also identified a similar core network (SN/VTA, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, insula, hippocampus and amygdala). The results suggest that the passionate behaviour experienced by football fans involves a similar core of key neural structures underlying reward and affective processing. The reward value taken from the vivid football moments can act as the motivational ‘glue’ that keeps the in-group cohesion suggested by other studies. \n\nHowever, we did not find the pattern of deactivation that was identified in studies of romantic and maternal love, namely in the amygdaloid cortex, posterior cingulate, middle temporal cortex and lateral prefrontal ( ,  ). Importantly, in the present study, the amygdala showed increased activity in the contrasts ‘positive   vs   negative’ and ‘positive   vs   neutral’, and the posterior cingulate showed increased activity in both ‘positive   vs   neutral’ and ‘negative   vs   neutral’ contrasts. The positive involvement of posterior cingulate was expected due to the memory content and limbic processing likely triggered by positive and negative content. The fact that amygdala activation was biased for positive valence stimuli is further discussed in ‘Activation in the reward system is modulated by the level of fanaticism’ section. \n\nLangeslag and colleagues used an oddball task with pictures of the participants’ loved partners and friends (serving as target and distractor stimuli alternately) to examine how attention modulates the response in regions consistently found in studies concerning romantic love. The results suggested that the dorsal striatum is not activated by romantic information per se, but only when such information is attended to ( ). A study of the neural correlates of hate showed that both the insula and putamen are also activated in addition to romantic love studies ( ). The present paradigm supports the notion of a common architecture of processing of love related information but also important distinctions underlying passionate attachment to a team. \n\n  In-group love   vs   out-group hate.    The contrast of ‘loved team’s positive   v   s   rival’s negative’ moments (direct self-oriented positive affect   vs   indirect positive affect possibly triggered by negative rival outcomes) showed larger activation in the right inferior parietal lobule and right inferior frontal gyrus, which belong to the mirror neuron system. Decreased activity was found in the left superior frontal gyrus. Decreases in the superior frontal gyrus were found to be associated to favourite brand content in a decision task ( ). Mirror neuron system networks located in the inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) and the inferior frontal gyrus (BA44) are thought to support self-relevant perception-action loops ( ;  ). An fMRI study has accordingly shown that group membership can modulate the neural activity in the inferior parietal lobule ( ).  ) suggested that this result is possibly due to the fact that the human brain simulates the actions of in-group members more easily than the out-group members’ actions. Our results of the contrast of ‘loved team’s positive   v   s   rival’s negative’ moments corroborate this view ( ). \n   \nRegions revealed by the contrast of ‘loved team’s positive   vs   rival’s negative’ moments \n    \n\nOutgroup hate is a commonly perceived counterpart of in-group love, and such types of negative feelings are very common in football fans (e.g. Manchester United   vs   Manchester City). A neurobehavioural response can therefore be triggered, as suggested by our data, by the negative videos for the rival team, which could possibly generate ‘unfair’ positive feelings in football fans. \n\n\n### The role of the amygdala \n  \n  Amygdala activation for positive videos.    The amygdala has been consistently reported to be engaged in situations of negative emotions, fear and aggression. Concerning the studies of love, Bartels and colleague found that the amygdaloid region (left in the whole group and bilateral in the female group) showed evidence for deactivation when contrasting conditions when participants viewed loved partner’s photos   vs   friends’ photos ( ). A similar bilateral deactivating pattern in amygdala was found by others ( ;  ), while Acevedo and colleagues suggested that the right amygdala deactivates in early-stage love, while the left amygdala activates in long-term love ( ). A study on maternal love showed a similar bilateral pattern of deactivation when viewing pictures of one’s own child as compared with pictures of a child acquaintance ( ). Intriguingly,  ) suggested that poorer quality of the maternal experience is related to decreases in the amygdala response, as tested by using a similar paradigm of viewing own and unfamiliar child’s pictures. A racial in-group   vs   out-group study found differential responses in the amygdala, which showed decreased activity for viewing in-group members’ faces when compared with viewing out-group faces ( ). Importantly, this difference in amygdala activity was shown to be correlated with implicit measures of racial bias ( ). \n\nA meta-analysis about reward processing in obesity and substance addiction provided clear evidence that the affected participants showed amygdala hyperactivity when processing rewarding stimuli, either general or related with the problematic condition ( ). Another review confirmed the view that the amygdala is involved in the processing of both appetitive and aversive stimuli ( ). \n\nIt is also known that amygdala plays a role in the recognition of faces in general ( ). The role of the amygdala in affective social cognition and love, either romantic, maternal and in-group love seems therefore to be distinct, raising questions about differential nature of content-related processing biases. \n\n  Amygdala, the reward system and emotional memory.    The reward system is considered an ancient structure from an evolutionary perspective, due to its fundamental role on the regulation of behaviours that are associated with its value. This implies that the structures that are part of this system engage in a type of processing that, although not purely mnemonic in nature, is crucial for emotional memory, as affective arousal enhances memory consolidation. Interestingly, the contrast results of ‘positive   vs   negative’ valent conditions showed a pattern of changes largely overlapping the neural network of the human reward system. This result reinforces the notion that the positive videos of football are perceived as positive input stimuli, generating emotional arousal, and are then interpreted as a ‘to repeat’ (reinforced) pattern while it is memorized, engaging the reward system with differential weights concerning positive   vs   negative stimuli. The amygdala can have a facilitator role in emotional mnemonic processes in the assessment of positive rewarding stimuli, by reinforcing behaviours of positive payoff rather than negative ones. We suggest that, in this study, as it receives input from the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, the amygdala plays a role in emotional arousal and learning by processing motivationally relevant information, preferentially in positive valence conditions. The finding of a correlation between the contrast of ‘positive   v   s   negative’ with the fan assessment score (FSFS) in the amygdala, as well as in structures of the reward system, supports this conceptual framework. \n\n\n### Activation in the reward system is modulated by the level of fanaticism \n  \nRFX analysis showed that viewing images of intense moments of participants’ loved team engages classical dopaminergic reward regions. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between the contrast of ‘positive   vs   negative’ with the fanaticism score (FSFS) in the amygdala, inferior temporal lobe, parahippocampus, right insula, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, VTA and SN. Hence, the individual FSFS score partially explains the variance of BOLD differences between positive and negative conditions in these regions. So higher the fanaticism score, higher the modulation of the BOLD signal as a function of positive content. \n\nThe most fanatic participants, besides reporting their football experiences differently, do actually experience football moments differently as evidenced by this type of analysis. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nWe investigated the neural basis of the love for a football team as a type of tribal attachment. We found the involvement of the amygdala and reward system regions such as VTA and SN in the processing of this type of affect. The observation of an increased response bias in these areas preferentially to positive stimuli of the loved team suggests that this kind of non-romantic love represents a strong motivational state, with a bias for processing positive content. The amygdala is proposed to have a facilitator role in emotional mnemonic processes in the assessment of positive rewarding stimuli, reinforcing behaviours of positive outcome rather than negative ones. Furthermore, fanaticism scores were strongly associated with individual response differences elicited by positive   vs   negative affective in-group experiences, thus implicating a weighting bias concerning neural responses for reward   vs   punishment. \n\n\n## Supplementary data \n  \n are available at   SCAN   online. \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"6562114fffaddd3ef7b05fa38c4976c7"},

Hence, the anticipation of tickling contributes to the final outburst of ticklish laughter. To localize the neuronal substrates of this process, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted on 31 healthy volunteers. The state of anticipation was simulated by generating an uncertainty respecting the onset of manual foot tickling. Anticipation was characterized by an augmented fMRI signal in the anterior insula, the hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area, as well as by an attenuated one in the internal globus pallidus. Furthermore, anticipatory activity in the anterior insula correlated positively with the degree of laughter that was produced during tickling. These findings are consistent with an encoding of the expected emotional consequences of tickling and suggest that early regulatory mechanisms influence, automatically, the laughter circuitry at the level of affective and sensory processing. Tickling activated not only those regions of the brain that were involved during anticipation, but also the posterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex and the periaqueductal gray matter. Sequential or combined anticipatory and tickling-related neuronal activities may adjust emotional and sensorimotor pathways in preparation for the impending laughter response. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nThe anticipation of a sensation of tickling is considered to be an integral part of the mechanism underlying ticklish laughter ( ). Since the tickling that induces laughter is applied particularly to vulnerable bodily parts, it is initially anticipated as a potential threat. It may be reappraised as harmless during the actual stimulation, which is frequently associated even with positive feelings ( ). This circumstance is exemplified by a child’s reaction to the menace of tickling, which involves an attempt to escape from it, screaming or laughter. Hence, the anticipation of tickling appears to trigger neuronal processes that are relevant during laughter. Investigations appertaining to the neuronal responses of humor and laughter have progressively targeted the focus of interest ( ;  ;  ), not least regarding their association with physiological parameters ( ) and the impact of affect-regulating pathways ( ). As yet, the inter-dependency of laughter and the related anticipatory processes has not been a subject of study. \n\nAccording to James ( ), the expectation of an externally applied stimulus involves the same centers in the brain as those that are related to its actual experience. During the act of stimulation, this mechanism would help to improve the efficiency with which the information is processed. For example, the primary sensorimotor cortices that are involved in the anticipation of touch and of tickling are similar to those that are implicated in the actual sensory experience ( ). The sense of touch mediates not only a discriminatory but also an affective dimension ( ), which, if sufficiently potent, triggers an emotional reaction. This response involves changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiration and vocalization. In the case of tickling, vocalization is manifested as laughter. Hence, the affective response to tickling and the related anticipatory processes may be deep-seated in the same brain centers. \n\nEmotional reactions are driven by the so-called emotional motor system—an ancient, involuntarily regulated pathway that complements the voluntary system [reviewed by  )]. The midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) is an important relay in this system; it is immediately implicated in the expression of emotions, including the control and the co-ordination of the motor neurons that are involved in laryngeal and respiratory movements ( ). There is broad scientific concordance in considering the PAG as pivotal in triggering vocalization in various species, including humans [( ,  ;  ), see also  ]. Laryngeal and respiratory vocal effectors are also controlled by the volitional motor system, notably, in humans, by newly developed primary motor regions exhibiting monosynaptic connections [( ;  ;  ), see also  ]. This situation permits the production of a flexible vocal repertoire including speech and song. By contrast, core processes for laughter as a spontaneous form of emotional vocalization appear to be seated in subcortical regions. This tenet is supported by the observation that laughter is vividly produced in infants at an early age, namely, by the fourth month. Furthermore, patients with bilateral damage at sites of the motor cortex that are associated with vocal control lose the ability to sing and speak while retaining the capacity to produce non-verbal emotional utterances, such as moans, cries and laughter ( ). The PAG is strongly interconnected with numerous brain regions that are associated with the limbic system, particularly with the lateral hypothalamus ( ), which is intrinsically coupled with the emotional motor system ( ). Investigations in the squirrel monkey suggest that the hypothalamus furnishes the most substantial input to implement vocalizations that accompany emotional states ( ). In the rat, the lateral hypothalamus is involved in vocalizations that are related to the expression of positive emotions ( ), notably to those that occur in the context of tickling and play ( ). In humans, the lateral hypothalamus is activated during the processing of humor ( ;  ) and of ticklish laughter ( ). Both the hypothalamus and the PAG receive projections from the insula ( ); the latter represents a primary cortical relay for tactile afferents that mediate affective information ( ). The functions of the anterior insula (AI) are believed to be implicated in the triggering of human laughter ( ;  ). Interestingly in this context, the AI not only senses the physiological condition of the body and related feelings, but also estimates the impact of an upcoming stimulation on this bodily state ( ,  ). Furthermore, the AI is believed to form a part of a limbic-related processing network that produces an affective state in response to the emotional significance of a stimulus, which is then automatically relayed to regulate emotional behavior [( ), see also  ]. Along these lines, activity in this cortical region occurs during the experience of tickling or a pleasant touch and during the anticipation of these sensations ( ;  ). However, a possible involvement of downstream regions, such as the hypothalamus and the PAG, has not been considered thus far. Our own investigations have permitted us to demonstrate activity that is associated with ticklish laughter in the AI/hypothalamic/PAG axis ( ;  ). However, in these former studies, no attempt was made to locate the sites of activity that are associated with the preceding anticipatory processes. It was with this aim in view that the present study was conducted. The partial brain volume targeted included the three aforenamed key nodes of the emotional motor system. By focusing on the AI, the hypothalamus and the PAG, we have now distinguished the processes of anticipation from those that are relevant during tickling. \n  \nSimplified model of efferent pathways for vocal control in humans. Brain regions are indicated in yellow when bearing reference to, or representing the emotional motor pathway, in green when being assigned to the voluntary motor pathway, and in lime-green when relating to the effectors for vocal output. The PAG is crucial for the control of emotional vocal expression via its connections with the nucleus ambiguus (laryngeal effectors) and the nucleus retroambiguus [respiratory/vocal coordination (Jurgens, 2002;  ;  )]. The PAG-activity is driven by the hypothalamus, which furnishes the main input for spontaneous vocal reactions ( ). The PAG is also a target of efferences from the ACC. The ACC is an evolutionarily older cortical site, which appears to support a directed expression of vocalization ( ). In humans, the functions of the dorsal ACC include emotional intonations that are superimposed on the production of volitional speech (Barrett   et al.  , 2004; Aziz-Zadeh   et al.  , 2010;  ; Dichter   et al.  , 2018). The AI cortex senses the current affective state and automatically relays the corresponding information to the emotional motor system ( ). The ventral laryngeal motor cortex (LMCV) is the homologue of the non-human primate LMC, whereas the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex (LMCD) is unique in the human primary motor cortex. These primary motor cortical regions extend the potential of voluntary vocal control, permitting flexible speech and song, notably via the reticular formation of the lower brainstem and by direct connections with laryngeal effectors in the nucleus ambiguus ( ;  ;  ). \n  \nList of Abbreviations\n   \nA condition anticipation of tickling \n  \nACC anterior cingulate gyrus \n  \nAI anterior insula \n  \nAID anterior insula, dorsal \n  \nAIV anterior insula, ventral \n  \nBOLD Blood-oxygen-level-dependent \n  \nEPI echo planar imaging \n  \nC condition foot contact (touching) \n  \nfMRI functional magnetic resonance imaging \n  \nFWE family-wise error \n  \nPGI globus pallidus internal segment \n  \nPAG periaqueductal gray matter \n  \nHYP hypothalamus \n  \nLMCD laryngeal motor cortex, dorsal \n  \nLMCV laryngeal motor cortex, ventral \n  \nMI mid insula \n  \nMNI Montreal Neurological Institute \n  \nNAC nucleus accumbens \n  \nPI posterior insula \n  \nROI region of interest \n  \nSVC small volume correction \n  \nSPM statistical parametric mapping \n  \nT tickling \n  \nThalamus A thalamus nuclei anteriores \n  \nThalamus CM thalamus nucleus centromedianus \n  \nThalamus VA thalamus nucleus ventralis anterior \n  \nThalamus VL thalamus nucleus ventralis lateralis \n  \nThalamus VP thalamus nucleus ventralis posterior \n  \n\n\n## Materials and methods \n  \n### Subjects \n  \nAmong the 43 healthy participants, 31 (21 females and 10 males; mean age: 24.3 years; age range: 20–29 years) were included in the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Three individuals were discarded due to technical constraints during the acquisition process. Nine individuals were excluded from the evaluation because their head movements consistently exceeded the limit of head motion, as revealed by the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) re-alignment procedure (see Supplementary Information: Participants). The informed consent of all participants was obtained, and the procedure was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Greifswald, Germany (BB63/10). \n\n\n### Behavioral data \n  \nAn fMRI-adapted fiber-optic microphone (MR confon, Magdeburg, Germany) was used to record laughter during the scanning procedure. The audacity® software 2.1.1 (Audacity Team,  ) was implemented to evaluate the intensity of the audible signal. Laughter always involves a strong expiratory component, which, in its weaker form, may be produced without articulation. The occurrence of a strong expiration without an accompanying audible vocalization was thus classified as an expiratory bout of laughter. Bursts of laughter that consisted of only one audible articulation were defined as weak; those involving several (>1) audible articulations that were produced in rapid succession were defined as strong. A further subdivision of the latter category was not possible, since strong bouts of laughter often ended in undefined audible phenomena. According to this approach, the intensity of laughter was assessed in an escalating form, which may reflect the underlying neuronal processes: in primates, the intensity of a single burst of vocalization is correlated with neuronal activity in the PAG, which is the critical region of its initiation ( ). Existing publications report on the correlation between the physical magnitude of the specific sensory stimuli and the exponential neuronal responses in the lower range of the perceived phenomenon ( ). Considering that in the present investigation we frequently reported expiratory responses without an accompanying audible vocalization (weak reaction, see Results), we here simplified the predicted exponential trend of the neuronal response that was elicited and coded the different intensities of bouts of laughter with exponential weights (expiratory laughter = 1×, weak laughter = 2×, strong laughter = 4×). For each participant, maximally 15 scores for the 15 tickling events were determined in this way. Calculation of the sum of these scores permitted a classification of the total vocal response that was produced during the tickling periods in terms of both the frequency and the intensity of the audible events. This value was used for the correlation analysis of this parameter with the anticipatory or the tickling-related activity. After the fMRI session, the participants completed a questionnaire in which they were requested to rate the mean sensation of tickling and the perceived pleasantness on a visual analogue scale, ranging from 1–10, with 1 being the lowest score (no sensation of tickle or pleasantness) and 10 the highest. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 21 (IBM) and Excel (Microsoft). \n\n\n### Experimental fMRI design \n  \nWe investigated the selected brain volume in the framework of an event-related paradigm with the following three conditions: (i) tickling of the right foot (T) by a friend or his/her partner. In this condition, the participant was encouraged not to suppress the audible vocalizations ( ). (ii) Monotonous foot contacts (C). (iii) Anticipation (A), which precedes the T or the C stimulus ( ). Upcoming episodes of T or C were visually indicated by the same ‘smiley face’. To prevent habituation of the person being tickled, the T and the C stimulations were executed with a variable delay (jitter) of up to 4.9 s (mean: 2.45 s; SD: 1.5), which represents the anticipatory activity (A). A jittering of successive stimuli also improves the evaluation accuracy in event-related designs ( ). A red bar, which was visible only to the tickler, was randomly superimposed on the left or the right side of the screen, at the end of the anticipatory period, and served as the signal to begin the episode of tickling (T) or touching (C). Each of these two conditions (T and C) was presented 15 times, each with a duration of 6.2 s and alternated with a baseline condition (11.2 s) in which participants had to look at a fixation cross. Technical and methodological difficulties are frequently encountered during the testing of a paradigm that is associated with physical motions. To minimize head movements and the associated artefacts in the fMRI signal, the participants held a wooden barbecue stick between their teeth, which did not interfere with the production of laughter ( ;  ). Since this procedure involves an exertion of the facial muscles during the entire scanning session, it may account for confounding brain activity due to smiling ( ) during T. \n  \nExperimental design. During the fMRI-scanning procedure, the participants experienced two different sensory stimulations, which were randomly applied: simple contact (C) or tickling (T) of the right foot. A visual cue signalized the upcoming stimulation, which followed only after a variable delay—the phase of anticipation (A)—of 0.1 to 4.9 s. To secure the unpredictability of the situation to the tickled person, the nature of the stimulation (tickling or touching) was signalized to the tickler alone by a superimposed red bar on the screen at the onset. The corresponding neuronal activity was measured in a defined brain volume, which included the AI, the hypothalamus and the PAG. A picture of a participant has been included, demonstrating the experimental set-up that was used. \n  \n\n### Acquisition of data \n  \nImaging was performed on a 3 T Scanner (VERIO, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 12-channel head-coil. Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence [repetition time (TR): 2 s; echo time (TE): 30 ms; flip angle [α]: 70°], which embraced the anterior insula, the hypothalamus and the PAG in 20 interleaved axial slices (resolution: 1.73 × 1.73 × 2 mm ; matrix: 64 × 64 × 20 voxels; total acquisition time: 608 s). The frontal and the occipital poles were not included in this brain volume (see  ). A phase-oversampling strategy was implemented to avoid folding artifacts. To minimize susceptibility artifacts, images were additionally tilted by 30  relative to the anterior/posterior commissure [AC-PC line ( )]. For a gradient-echo field mapping, 34 phase and magnitude images were acquired [TR: 488 ms; TE(1): 4.92 ms; TE(2): 7.38 ms; [α]: 60 ; resolution: 1.73 × 1.73 × 2 mm ]. A T1-weighted, three-dimensional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (TR: 1900 ms; TE: 2.52 ms; [α]: 9°; voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm ; matrix: 256 × 256 × 176 voxels; 176 sagittal slices) was used to obtain structural images of the brain anatomy. \n\n\n### Analysis of data \n  \nData were analyzed using SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, London, England) ( ), running on Matlab version R2012a (MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA). \n\nThe pre-processing procedure involved an unwarping of the geometrically distorted functional images (EPIs) in the phase-encoding direction using the FieldMap toolbox for SPM8. After slice-timing correction, each of the 304 individual volumes was re-aligned to the one which displayed half-maximal displacement (as indicated by the translation or rotation parameters with the highest maximal deviation) to correct for motion artifacts. Slow-signal drifts were eliminated using a temporal high-pass filter (128 s). Each EPI was co-registered with the T1-weighted anatomical image. The co-registered T1-image was segmented and normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template; EPIs were resliced at 1.73 × 1.73 × 2 mm . The resulting EPIs were smoothed with a 6 × 6 × 6 mm Gaussian Kernel filter (full-width at half maximum). \n\nFirst-level analysis: to control for variance due to motions of the head, movement parameters that were estimated during the re-alignment procedure were introduced as regressors into the general linear model. The fMRI data were additionally adjusted for artifacts by a reduced weighting of motion-contaminated volumes using the RobustWLS toolbox ( ). An event-related analysis was conducted to separately identify the regions of the brain that were activated by the anticipation (A) and the tickling (T) stimuli in each subject. A reaction and neuronal conduction time of 400 ms after the request to effectively tickle was included in the modeling, which is shorter than the period that was implemented in our previous investigation (1 s), in which the participants could not prepare in advance ( ). We proceeded in the same way for the evaluation of the C condition. Contrast images were calculated to describe the comparisons T > A and T > C. \n\nSecond-level analysis: a hypothesis-driven SPM analysis was undertaken in a region of interest (ROI) that comprised the bilateral anterior insular cortex (AI), the midbrain and the bilateral hypothalamus. The anterior insular cortex (AI) was included with a view to relating regional activation patterns with the monitored and corresponding affective state ( ). The midbrain and the hypothalamus were included with a view to revealing the impact thereon of the behavioral reaction ( ). The AI was defined according to data that are presented in the Anatomical Atlas of Neuromorphometrics [SPM ( )]. The midbrain/hypothalamus was defined according to the Atlas of the Automated Anatomic Labeling (AAL) toolbox ( ). Functional maps appertaining to the conditions anticipation (A), tickling (T) and monotonous foot contacts (C) as well as to T   vs   A and T   vs   C were analyzed in the predefined ROI volume, based on a small volume correction (SVC) at the voxel level. Voxels were considered to be significant if they survived a family-wise-error (FWE)-corrected threshold (  P   < 0.05) that was adjusted for the small volume. With a view to classifying activities in accordance with the results of our previous investigation on ticklish laughter ( ), the described evaluations were complemented with an explorative analysis of the brain volume which has been measured. Thus, in addition to activity in the AI, the hypothalamus and the PAG, that in the mid- and the posterior portions of the insular cortex, the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and portions of the parietal, the temporal and the frontal lobes were also evaluated. In this instance, the results for T, A and C, as well as for T   vs   A and T   vs   C, were reported at a significance threshold of   P   < 0.05, which was FWE-corrected (voxel level) for the multiple comparisons involving the measured brain volume. \n\nA linear-regression analysis (implemented in SPM8) permitted a correlation between each participant’s total (intensity-weighted) vocal output in response to tickling and the corresponding beta values (effect size) of the anticipation (A) and the tickling (T) events. The results are reported for the two aforementioned ROIs (anterior insula and midbrain/hypothalamus) after an SVC analysis with a corrected threshold of   P   (FWE) < 0.05 at the voxel level that was adjusted for the small volume. \n\nThe anatomical locations of significant areas of activation were identified using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox [(version 21 ( )] and the Atlas of the Human Brain ( ). The posterior and the mid, as well as the dorsal and the ventral anterior regions of the insular cortex, were distinguished according to the labeling patterns that were reported by Wager and Barrett ( ). To assess a potential impact of motion artifacts on the BOLD signal, scan-to-scan frame displacements (calculated by the sum of the six motion parameters for head movements combined over all volumes) were introduced as the regressor [see ( ;  )] in a further analysis of the A and the T conditions (  P   < 0.001, uncorrected). \n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavior \n  \nSix of the 31 participants manifested an audible response to each of the 15 episodes of tickling; four exhibited no reaction whatsoever (median: 11). The intensity of an event of ticklish laughter was gauged as ‘strong’ (number of events: 0–15; median: 3), ‘weak’ (number of events: 0–4; median: 0) or ‘expiratory’ (number of events: 0–12; median: 3). The differences in intensity were taken into account in calculating the amount of laughter that was produced by each participant (see Methods). The average aggregated score per subject was 24.2 (‘strong’ laughter: 4.71, weighted as 18.84; ‘weak’ laughter: 0.81, weighted as 1.62; ‘expiratory’ laughter: 3.74). With respect to this parameter, no significant differences were observed between males and females (Mann–Whitney test;   P   = 0.44). The participants rated the stimulus as ‘pleasant’ [mean score: 7.18 (SD: ±1.9) of 10; no significant gender differences] and as ‘rather ticklish’ [mean score: 5.35 (SD: ±2.1) of 10; no significant gender differences]. Ticklishness correlated with the amount of laughter that was produced (Pearson’s test: r = 0.477,   P   = 0.007). \n  \nGroup-related activity during tickling and its anticipation. Panel A: the anticipation of the affective stimulation (A) involved the AI, the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and the hypothalamus (HYP). In the illustrated example, the level of significance for threshold activity was set at   P   < 0.001 (uncorrected). Panel B: tickling and the accompanying laughter (T) activated the mid (MI) and the posterior (PI) regions of the insula, the hypothalamus (HYP) and the PAG (  P   < 0.001; uncorrected). Activation of the nucleus accumbens as well as of the anterior insular cortex is not represented. The right hemisphere (R) is indicated. \n    \nAnticipatory and tickling-associated activity correlating with laughter. Panel A: the AI cortex of both hemispheres was activated during the anticipation of tickling (A). In the illustrated example (  P   < 0.001; uncorrected), activation of the AI in the right hemisphere involved not only the ventral (AIV), but also the dorsal (AID) portions. Panel B: anticipatory (A) activity in the anterior dorsal insula (AID) predicts the laughter reaction during tickling (  P   < 0.001; uncorrected). Panel C: the scatterplot shows the relationship between the beta values (effect size) that were derived from the peak of activity in the AID of the right hemisphere and the degree of laughter (summed score of the weighted laughter bursts) that was emitted during tickling (r2 = 0.43,   P   = 0.001). The right hemisphere (R) is indicated. \n  \n\n### FMRI results \n  \nThe brain regions that were activated in anticipation of tickling (A) and those that were associated with tickling (T) could be clearly distinguished by their extent of activation in the insular cortex of both hemispheres. A was associated with activation in the anterior insula (AI), whereas T involved additional activity in its posterior (PI) and mid (MI) portions (  and  ,  ,  ). The anticipatory situation (A) was associated with significant activation in additional sites: the bilateral nucleus accumbens (extending into the putamen in the left hemisphere), the posterior lateral hypothalamus in the left hemisphere and the ventral tegmental area. During tickling (T), activity was likewise detected in the nucleus accumbens (extending from the putamen and the pallidum) and the lateral hypothalamus, but also in the thalamus, the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the PAG, the brainstem tegmentum and the cerebellum in both hemispheres. The activity in the PAG appears to be localized in two longitudinally oriented columns ventrolateral ( ) to the midbrain aqueduct (see  ). Activation of the ACC was significant in the direct comparisons T > A and T > C and that of large portions of the pallidum in the comparison T > A (see  ). A closer inspection of the data confirmed an attenuated fMRI signal in the bilateral internal segments of the globus pallidus during A (24-10-4; z = 6.30/-24-8-6; z = 6.26, see  ). An analysis of the activity relating to monotonous foot contacts (C) revealed the response to tickling to be distinct from non-ticklish touch (see  ,   and  ). In particular, the involvement of subcortical regions was specific for the tickling but not for the touching condition. By contrast, during both forms of somatosensory stimulation, the right posterior superior temporal sulcus was involved, which points to the social dimension of both situations ( ). \n\nThe laughter score correlated positively with anticipatory activity in the dorsal AI on the right side ( ,  ). In the right midbrain tegmentum, it was related to episodes of tickling ( ). \n\nThe quality control revealed that when the individual summed motion-frame-displacement values were implemented in a second-level regression analysis, only a few voxel values attained statistical significance for condition T (cerebellum: z = 3.52, voxels = 6; putamen: z = 3.22, voxels = 6) and none for condition A. Thus, a major confounding effect of motion on the results can be excluded. \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nIn our previous studies ( ;  ), the experimental set-up did not differentiate between anticipation of tickling (A) and tickling itself (T). It now appears that activity in the AI and in the hypothalamus is associated with A and with T, while that in the mid-posterior portions of the insula (MI, PI) and in the PAG is primarily involved in the T-condition. These findings accord with those of previous investigations addressing the brain representation of affective touch ( ;  ), namely, as appertaining to the distribution of anticipatory and stimulus-related activity in the insular cortex. However, in these former studies, no activity was revealed in the hypothalamus and the PAG, two subcortical centers that participate in an imminent behavioral response ( ). It is conceivable that, during the anticipation of tickling, an internal representation of the expected consequences is used and combined in a modified reaction to the actual stimulation. \n\n### The anticipation of tickling is associated with neuronal activity in the anterior insula \n  \nThe posterior insular cortex contains primary interoceptive afferences that the anterior portions integrate with cognitive and limbic-related information ( ;  ;  ). This process represents the basis of emotional experiences and has been associated with a broad spectrum of functional conditions ( ). The anterior insular cortex (AI) is believed to comprise a portion of the neuronal network that produces an affective state corresponding to an emotional stimulation ( ). Interestingly in this context, an anticipation of the averse consequences of a stimulus invariably leads to an activation of the AI and, at the same time, is associated with autonomous excitement and behavioral changes ( ). Indeed, the prediction of an affective state in the absence of a peripheral input appears to be a key role of the AI ( ). This observation may also apply to tickling or a pleasant touch: although activity in the AI has been observed during the sensory stimulation itself ( ;  ), this region appears to be specifically implicated in paradigms that signal an upcoming experience of the related bodily sensations ( ). Our data support the implication that the AI is involved in the anticipation of tickling (A). The functions that involve its right ventral portion permit the drawing of further conclusions. \n  \nMain effects of tickling (T) and of anticipation (A) and correlating activity of (A) and of (T) with the laughter that was produced during (T) \n    \nOne of the characteristics of tickling is that during the act itself, it is re-interpreted as a harmless stimulus. The continuous up-dating of information appertaining to the actual situation is assumed to be supported by the von Economo neurons (VEN) in the ventral portion of the AI ( ), which have been implicated in the rapid, highly integrated representations of an emotional experience ( ). In a previous study, the mechanism that underlies the recognition and the re-appraisal of humorous stimuli has indeed been explained by this process ( ). The ventral AI [agranular, see ( )] is functionally involved in an affective state that is generated according to an emotional rather than a cognitive input ( ). This region appears to be the seat of feelings that are not defined or interpreted ( ), such as those that are associated with the experience of one of the basic emotions ( ) or a state of intensified drive [e.g. the craving for food ( )]. The ventral AI also participates in the regulation of peripheral physiological changes that are related to affective states ( ). Notably, neuronal activity that is restricted to the right ventral AI signalizes higher sympathetic arousal ( ), as gauged, for example, by the concomitant change in skin conductance that occurs during the experience of positive emotions ( ). Moreover, in the rat, efferent sympathetic projections from the agranular and the dysgranular insular cortices have been traced ( ;  ). This discovery serves as more than circumstantial evidence of the insula’s involvement in regulation via the sympathetic nervous system, which has been verified in humans: unexpected cardiac events following insular stroke are deemed to be associated with the sympathetic role of the right AI ( ). Hence, during the anticipation of tickling, the dextroventral AI possibly acts as a dynamic point of reference ( ) in the automatic regulation of the laughter circuitry. \n\n\n### The anticipation of tickling is associated with neuronal activity in the lateral hypothalamus, the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area \n  \nAn involvement of the lateral hypothalamus in human laughter was first suggested by findings in pathological situations ( ), relating, in particular, to those in which its tuberolateral portions were lesioned ( ) and has been confirmed by the results of our previous fMRI study ( ). The hypothalamus is anatomically connected to several regions of the brainstem, notably to the PAG ( ). It is deemed to stimulate the PAG to implement the motoric patterns of affective vocalizations ( ). However, our investigation revealed that, in the anticipation of tickling (A) the posterior lateral hypothalamus, but not the PAG was activated. In this context, it is of interest that a substantial proportion of the neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area of rats and monkeys respond specifically to appetitive or aversive situations themselves rather than to associated sensory or motoric processes ( ;  ). Also, the results of imaging studies in healthy individuals have confirmed the function of the (lateral) hypothalamus to be associated with the processing of the emotional valence of a stimulus ( ). Interestingly, experiments in the squirrel monkey have revealed stimulation of the PAG to evoke changes in the intensity, but not in the specific acoustic parameters, such as rhythm or the articulation of vocalizations ( ;  ). This finding is compatible with a role of this region in initiating and gating rather than in elaborating the vocal response. Hence, any anticipatory influence of the hypothalamus on the PAG (e.g. on the intensity of the vocal response) would become manifest only during the actual vocalization. Moreover, during the anticipatory phase, respiration is being imperceptibly adjusted to prepare for laughter, a process that always occurs in the post-inspiratory expiratory phase ( ). By its influence on respiration ( ), the lateral hypothalamus could play an indirect role in regulating the laryngeal voice box, perhaps via vocal pattern generators in the parvicellular reticular formation ( ). In addition, our findings reveal the anticipation of tickling to involve the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmental area. These regions support not only the processing of emotionally salient or rewarding events in humans ( ), but also the development of responses to predictive cues, at least in rats ( ;  ). \n\n\n### Laughter-associated anticipatory activity involves the anterior insula \n  \nIn those participants who manifested higher anticipatory activity in the dorsal AI of the left hemisphere, laughter was consistently more pronounced during the act of tickling (T). This finding implies an influence at a level of stimulus-encoding that relates to cognitive appraisal. In their meta-analysis, Wager and Barrett ( ) reported emotional situations in which undifferentiated affective states need to be translated into plans of action to be powerful predictors of activity in the dorsal AI [dysgranular, see ( )]. This region is activated in situations that implicate specific avoidance or approach strategies, for example, those in which an individual is attentive to painful ( ) or other incentive external stimuli ( ). Analogously, in our study, those participants who attached more importance to, or consistently anticipated the sensory stimulation, were probably more ticklish and accordingly more prone to laughter. As an example, an investigation of the neuronal correlates of touch by Lovero et al. ( ) revealed anticipatory activity in the AI to be correlated with that in a more mid-to-posterior region that responds during stimulation. This process would thus directly enhance the sensory response, if coupled, in terminal fields for primary interoceptive afferents. \n\n\n### Tickling with accompanying laughter activates an emotional and sensorimotor network \n  \nIn contrast to the anticipatory phase (A), the act of tickling itself (T) was associated with a more extensive pattern of activation in regions of the brain that included the PAG, the amygdala, the basal ganglia, the lateral hypothalamus and the insula. As far as this finding goes, our results confirm those of our earlier investigation on ticklish laughter ( ). However, in the present study, with an adapted paradigm, a more discriminative analysis was possible. Firstly, A and T likewise activated the anterior insular cortex (AI), whereas only the latter condition involved its mid-posterior portions (MI, PI). Evidence deriving from a variety of species indicates that the PI receives primary interoceptive information from the ventral posterior thalamus ( ). This region not only associates the incoming information with subjective evaluation in the AI ( ), but also projects directly to the same posterior thalamic region, as well as to the dorsolateral striatum ( ;  ). In humans, decision-making processes related to actions that are relatively automatic or habitual are mediated by neuronal circuitries involving the sensorimotor cortices and the dorsolateral striatum/putamen ( ). Moreover, the suppression of activity in the internal segment of the globus pallidus during A, suggests that the inhibitory input from this region to the anterior and the ventrolateral thalamus ( ) was restricted and that the motor-related functions of these thalamic regions were probably disinhibited. Hence, more direct and automatic processes may be implemented in the evocation of laughter. In this respect, our findings accord with existing data, which afford evidence that an involuntary ( ) and ‘reflex-like’ ( ) mechanism underlies the outburst of laughter in humans. \n\nSecondly, we found that T activated the ACC, which has both autonomic and emotional regulatory functions ( ). Referring to research on vocalizations in the squirrel monkey, the ACC is believed to initiate directed but not reflexive vocal behavior via its projections to the PAG ( ). In humans, this region has been implicated in the volitional control of the affective components of vocalization ( ), for example, when angry manifestations are produced on command ( ). In our previous investigation, this region was not activated during T. However, in the present study, the entire epoch of T was investigated, whereas in the previous one, only the early response to T was considered. It is conceivable that during the ongoing stimulation, an awareness of the social dimension of the situation sets in, therewith involving control functions in the ACC. This social awareness may serve to regulate the magnitude of the vocal reaction ( ) or, more subtly, to signalize social status by context-dependent frequency modulations ( ). The extent to which ticklish laughter involves obligatory control by the cortical centers is currently unknown. \n\nIn the present study, the neuronal processes that are initiated by the anticipation of tickling could, for the first time, be distinguished from those that are evoked by the act of tickling itself. It is conceivable that in a natural (non-experimental) setting, with its accompanying menacing gestural components, the equivalent anticipatory activity would be more potent and specific, eliciting vocalizations such as screaming and laughter. Moreover, some of the participants may have exhibited a tendency to react in a purely expiratory manner to T whereas others may have vocalized intensively when exposed to a comparable stimulation. To improve the characterization of the triggering processes of ticklish laughter, future fMRI studies could investigate, in parallel, multiple physiological parameters, such as changes in skin conductance, with a view to correlating them with the rated audible expressions. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nThe pattern of activity that characterizes the anticipation of tickling was distinct from the one that is manifested during effective stimulation. This finding modifies and extends James’ contention ( ) that the same brain regions are involved during the expectation and the experience of an externally applied stimulus. Anticipation of tickling apparently evokes regulatory processes that are directly and indirectly coded in the emotional and the sensorimotor systems. In this way, the two pathways can be adjusted for laughter. \n\n\n## Funding \n  \nThe present work was funded by the Swiss National Foundation (grant no. 31003A-144036). \n\n\n## Supplementary Material \n  \n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"9f9d0732dd85dffa1c147d7bca5a791a"},

A novel functional MRI task paradigm involving wrist movement was developed to gain insight into the effects of multimodal sensory feedback on brain functional networks in stroke participants. This paradigm consisted of an intermittent position search task using the wrist during fMRI signal acquisition with visual and auditory feedback of proximity to a target position. We enrolled 12 young adults, 10 participants with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis, and nine age-matched controls. Activation maps were obtained, and functional connectivity networks were calculated using an independent component analysis (ICA) approach. Task-based networks were identified using activation maps, and nodes were obtained from the ICA components. These nodes were subsequently used for connectivity analyses. Stroke participants demonstrated significantly greater contralesional activation than controls during the visual feedback condition and less ipsilesional activity than controls during the auditory feedback condition. The sensorimotor component obtained from the ICA differed between rest and task for control and stroke participants: task-related lateralization to the contralateral cortex was observed in controls, but not in stroke participants. Connectivity analyses between the lesioned sensorimotor cortex and the contralesional cerebellum demonstrated decreased functional connectivity in stroke participants (  p   < 0.005), which was positively correlated the Box and Blocks arm function test (  r   = 0.59). These results suggest that task-based functional connectivity provides detail on changes in brain networks in stroke survivors. The data also highlight the importance of cerebellar connections for recovery of arm function after stroke. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nIn this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a novel task paradigm to investigate the effects of multimodal sensory feedback on detection of brain functional networks after stroke. In prior studies, the primary motor cortical regions and their pathways have been a major focus in investigating the functional effects of stroke lesions on the brain ( – ). However, brain lesions might have an even stronger impact on integrative networks that process multisensory inputs and plan movements in a functional context. Lesions affecting sensorimotor integrative networks of the brain are likely to play a critical role in recovery, and damage to these networks could lead to chronic impairment, as they are important to motor learning and recovery ( ,  – ). Although current measures of functional connectivity characterize communication between brain motor regions, the changes in connectivity of the sensorimotor association areas have been largely unexplored in stroke survivors. In order to characterize the function of sensorimotor networks in stroke survivors, we measured brain connectivity and activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during rest and during tasks that invoked key features of sensorimotor and multisensory integration. \n\nfMRI has been used to characterize differences in brain activation patterns in stroke survivors and to document cortical plasticity with natural recovery or following targeted therapeutic interventions. In general, increased intensity and spread of brain activation after stroke have been associated with decreased functional outcomes. During finger movement, stroke survivors have increased cortical activation with a broader spatial extent in the ipsilesional hemisphere as well as contralesional activity that is absent in controls ( ). Increases in cortical activity distant from primary motor areas impacted by a stroke lesion are considered evidence for cortical reorganization ( ). These plastic changes might be compensatory or conversely, they could be maladaptive for functional recovery. During recovery, the intensity, and spread of brain activation associated with hand grip decreases in lower functioning stroke survivors ( ), suggesting that simple task-related brain activation volumes are inversely correlated with functional recovery. In contrast, decreased activity in cortical areas have been documented in stroke survivors using the relatively more complex task of bilateral pedaling during fMRI ( ), possibly due to a greater reliance on integrative sensorimotor regions that might become dysfunctional after stroke. The recent emergence of brain functional connectivity analyses ( ,  ) offers the opportunity to interpret changes in task-related brain activity in the context of brain networks, potentially offering insight into the mechanisms underlying changes in brain function after stroke. \n\nFunctional connectivity analyses also provide evidence of changes in brain function after stroke. Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) ( ,  ) infers coactivation of one or more cortical areas by their correlated fMRI signal over time. This analysis can be used to identify functional networks using fMRI signals obtained at rest ( ) or during a task ( ). For this analysis, nodes can be defined using predetermined anatomical regions of interest or identified by measuring regional homogeneity of voxel-wise intrinsic functional connectivity ( ). Alternatively, functional connectivity can be decomposed into a set of spatiotemporal networks using an independent component analysis ( ,  ); an independent component consists of a 3D volume that provides each voxel's contribution to a network and a BOLD time-course that is shared by all voxels within that network. In resting-state fMRI, one of the most consistent findings in stroke participants is decreased functional connectivity between the ipsilesional and contralesional sensorimotor cortices ( – ). While resting state functional connectivity and task-based connectivity share correspondence, they also have many notable differences ( – ). In healthy individuals, the spatial extent of nodes determined by an independent component analysis is similar across task and resting state paradigms ( ). In contrast, task-based connectivity exhibits “local specialization” with increased connectivity of long-distance connections compared to resting state analyses ( ,  ). This means that areas engaged in a given task have increased local connectivity in the task-specific area (i.e., local specialization) and increased global connectivity (long distance connections) between the different areas engaged with that task. For a multimodal sensorimotor task, we expect increased local specialization within the primary sensorimotor region and increased long-distance communication between the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortices and contralesional cerebellum, similar to activation results reported during complex motor tasks ( ). \n\nFunctional connectivity analyses are particularly effective in quantifying functionally relevant changes in brain networks after stroke and during recovery ( ). It has been suggested that network integrity and reorganization is critical for functional recovery after stroke ( ). Each cortical region can actively participate in multiple functional networks, allowing the brain to reorganize after damage to a particular node. Network plasticity has been documented in the motor network of people with stroke ( ) and the integrity of contralesional parietofrontal and sensorimotor cortical networks has been associated with lower motor impairment after stroke ( ). These findings suggest that resting state and task-based connectivity of sensorimotor integration areas predict motor function, and plasticity of these networks provide mechanisms for restoring motor function. \n\nIn order to identify changes in sensorimotor networks in chronic stroke survivors, we calculated the functional connectivity of the brain using resting state and task-based MRI, with a unique sensorimotor task that employs sensorimotor and multisensory integration. The task was specifically designed to engage integrative sensorimotor networks during controlled wrist movement. We then compared the changes in these networks to a clinical measure of upper limb function. We hypothesized that only during the task, functional connectivity between brain networks associated with sensorimotor integration would be reduced in stroke survivors, and that the reduction would be correlated to arm function. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Data Collection \n  \n#### Participant Recruitment and Clinical Testing \n  \nTwelve young adults (four female, 25.2 ± 2.4 years), 10 individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis (four female, age 66.7 ± 7.94 years, at least 1.1 years since stroke), and nine age-matched control participants (five female, age 64.2 ± 7.73 years) participated in this study. The young adults were included as additional data to validate the new task paradigm in its ability to show areas of the brain involved in performing the task. Each participant provided informed written consent to the experimental protocol, which was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at Marquette University and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Inclusion criteria included a history of an ischemic cortical or subcortical stroke that occurred no <6 months prior to recruitment. Participants with no ability to perform supination, pronation, ulnar deviation, or radial deviation of the wrist were excluded. Controls without history of stroke or other neurological impairments were age-matched (within 3 years) and gendered-matched to the stroke participants. Each stroke participant completed the upper extremity (UE) portion of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( ) for a maximum possible score of 126. Participants also completed the Box and Blocks Test of Manual Dexterity ( ), the Wolf Motor Function Test ( ) for upper extremity motor ability (maximum score of 75), and the Modified Ashworth Scale ( ). These clinical measurements were correlated with measured brain activity during the task and the functional connectivity during resting state and during the task. The stroke participant clinical scores and lesion locations are shown in  , and   shows the lesion distribution; although there is little lesion overlap, the lesion distribution shows damage in the sensorimotor pathways. \n  \nStroke participant clinical scores and lesion location. \n  \n Participant information including affected and dominant limb, lesion location, and clinical scores including Box and Blocks, Wolf Motor, and Fugl-Meyer upper extremity (CST, corticospinal tract; PLIC, posterior limb of the internal capsule; PrCG, pre-central gyrus; PoCG, post-central gyrus; CP, cerebral peduncle)  . \n  \n\n#### Experimental Paradigm \n  \nOur sensorimotor integration experiment was designed with cues and feedback that contrasted the effects of auditory and visual sensation. We introduced a task paradigm for studying the role of sensory integration in complex movement. Chronic stroke participants have more difficulty coordinating sensorimotor behavior, especially in tasks with higher complexity ( ). Our task required the participant to produce movement while integrating multiple sensory modalities. \n\n##### Motion recording and audiovisual feedback \n  \nEvery participant completed two sessions on separate days no more than 2 weeks apart. Participants were trained to perform a wrist-movement task during the first session. The second session used the same wrist movement task and consisted of a second training period 1 h before the task-based fMRI session. The experimental apparatus is shown in   (left). The forearm of the impaired limb was fixed on a small ramp to allow for radial and ulnar deviation of the wrist. Both the elbow and the forearm were secured on the ramp to ensure that the task was controlled by wrist movement only. The hand gripped the end of a ShapeTape device (Measurand Inc., Canada), an array of 16 optical fiber sensor pairs that provide 3D Euclidean coordinates along the sensor region. Each sensor pair also provided a 3D rotation matrix expressed in quaternion form. Visual feedback was presented on a computer monitor, and speakers provided auditory feedback. Motion data were recorded every 24 ms, or 41.67 Hz. \n  \nTask paradigm for wrist movement and sensorimotor integration.   (Left)   Illustration of the ShapeTape apparatus. The forearm position was fixed.   (Right)   Experimental design of the multisensory search task. During each trial, the participant maximized sensory feedback using wrist joint angles to minimize error to a target angle. The participant was instructed to move the wrist to maximize the circle diameter and/or a sound volume. Auditory, visual, or audiovisual feedback were presented at the start and during each trial. After reaching the target, the participant fixated on a yellow square during a 2–4 s intertrial period. The average trial duration was 5 s. \n  \nShown in   (left), two sensor pairs at the end of the ShapeTape were used to calculate a 3D ray with angle   θ=  {θ , θ } relative to the horizontal (x-z) plane, which was used to define the orientation of the wrist. Effectively, pronation/supination was mapped to an angle within the x-y plane θ , and radial and ulnar deviation was mapped to an angle in the z-y plane. Letting   p   and   p   be the 3D coordinates of the last two sensors, an orientation vector    v    was calculated as: \n\nThe wrist orientation was estimated as θ  = (  v  /  v  ), and θ  = (  v  /  v  ). For each search task, a target angle,   φ  , was created. The error to   φ   during the search task was calculated as  .   E   was then used to provide feedback to the participant related to wrist proximity to the target. The feedback intensity,   w  , was calculated as   w   = exp(−  E  /σ), with the sensitivity parameter σ fixed at 0.1 radians for all trials. Intensity   w   was used to modulate visual and auditory feedback stimuli. Auditory feedback was a 440 Hz tone and its volume was modulated linearly by   w  . Visual feedback was presented as a solid red circle at the center of a black screen. The circle diameter was modulated linearly by   w   from 15 to 160 pixels or 0.38–4.06 cm. The screen was placed ~2 feet away from the eyes. The resulting aperture angle was effectively varied 0.179–1.91 degrees. \n\n\n##### Experimental design \n  \nAs shown in   (right), a search-based wrist movement task was designed to invoke brain networks involved in sensorimotor and multisensory integration. The first session began with up to five familiarization trials, in which the participant used the wrist to move a white cursor to a yellow square target at the center of the screen. These trials were also used to verify the participant's range of motion. Once comfortable reaching the square, the participant was then informed that the square and cursor would not be visible. At the start of each trial, one of three types of sensory feedback was presented. For both the training session and the fMRI session, a series of two search-task runs (“search”) (6 min each) and one sensory-motor (“SM”) only run (6 min) were conducted. \n\nThe “search” task run consisted of a series of trials, each trial including visual, auditory, or combined audiovisual feedback. In the visual-only feedback condition, a solid red circle appeared and grew larger as error decreased. Once the participant reached the target, the solid red circle was changed into an outline and then disappeared. During auditory-only trials, the participant searched for the target with feedback provided by the tone volume. Upon reaching the target, the tone was altered to a fixed pitch of 880 Hz, giving a “beep” sound, and turned off. In audiovisual feedback trials, the red circle and auditory tone were mapped independently to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate errors. The goal was to maximize both feedback intensities. After the target was reached, the participant fixated at a yellow square at the center of the screen for an inter-trial period with a normal random duration of 2.5 ± 0.5 s. Participants were notified that the trial would end automatically after an unspecified time if they failed to reach the target. A maximum trial duration of 15 s was used for all experiments. \n\nA control task (“SM”) involving isolated sensory and motor tasks was conducted after the two search-based task runs. In the motor task, the words “Keep Moving” appeared on the screen, and the participant was told to move the wrist randomly in a similar pattern as during the search task. The participant was instructed to stop moving once the words disappeared. The message “Relax” was displayed on the screen for 2 s prior to the sensory only trials. For this condition, the participant was warned that there would be times during which the red circle and sound would appear and change outside of the participant's control. The participant was trained to not move and just watch and listen. The last instruction to the participant was “If you see the words “Keep moving” then move. If you do not see the words “Keep moving,” then stay still no matter what happens.” Throughout this final run, the experiment would alternate between motor-only and sensory-only conditions every 12 ± 2.0 s. \n\n\n\n#### MRI Scans \n  \nEvery participant was screened for MRI safety before entering the magnetic environment. An axial T1-weighted anatomical image was acquired using a fast spoiled gradient recalled (SPGR) pulse sequence, with TE: 3.2 ms, TR: 8.16 ms, flip angle: 12 deg, prep time: 450, bandwidth: 22.73, FOV: 240 mm, 156 1 mm slices, matrix size: 256 ×240. For functional MRI, a sagittal view gradient-echo echo-planar sequence was acquired with TE: 25 ms, TR: 2,000 ms, flip angle: 77 deg, FOV: 240 ×240 mm, 41 slices with 3.5 mm thickness. Four 6 min fMRI scans were performed, one for resting state, two for the search task, and one for the sensory motor only task. \n\n\n#### MRI Experimental Setup \n  \nAs the participant lay supine, the forearm was elevated with foam and fixed in place with sandbags. The ShapeTape was placed into the participant's impaired hand, or right hand in healthy adults. Visual feedback was projected to a visor attached to the head coil, and earbuds were placed into the ears to provide auditory feedback. The MRI scan session consisted of one resting-state run followed by three task-based runs. During the 6 min resting-state run, each participant was asked to close their eyes and stay alert. After the resting-state scan, the ShapeTape was placed into the participant's hand. If the participant had difficulty gripping the device, then a surgical wrap was used to keep the hand closed. The participant completed three 6-min runs of the same experiment conducted for the first session, including two search-based and one sensory-motor only. \n\n\n\n### Image Registration and Lesion Side Normalization \n  \nIntersubject and intermodality image registration was completed in both healthy adults and stroke participants using fully automated techniques. Each participant's anatomical T1-weighted MRI volume was registered to a 152-brain MNI space using a 12-parameter affine registration, and then non-linear image registration was performed using Maxwell's demons algorithm ( ). Local histogram matching was performed prior to deformable image registration in order to mitigate errors caused by lesion contrasts ( ). In brief, each voxel in the subject's T1-weighted image was assigned a value from 0 to 1 based on its percentile for a 5 ×5 ×5 voxel neighborhood centered at that voxel. The resulting deformed T1-weighted image was histogram-matched to the MNI template, where the local percentile of the subject's T1-weighted image was matched to the same percentile of the MNI template. Finally, 5 iterations of the demons algorithm were performed at the full 1 mm resolution to align the edges of the images. \n\nThe images of all stroke participants that completed the experiment with the left arm were flipped over the sagittal plane so that all lesions were on the left side of MNI space. One of these participants had a lesion within the left cerebellum, which was flipped to the right side. The flipping placed all strokes outside the cerebellum on the left side of MNI space. \n\n\n### fMRI Data Processing \n  \n#### General Linear Model for the Search Task \n  \nTask-based functional MRI analysis was performed with AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages, RRID:SCR_005927, afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni). Data were temporally resampled in order to correct for non-uniform slice acquisition timing within each volume. BOLD signal changes related to head translation and rotation were corrected by affine coregistration between volumes using AFNI's 3dvolreg function. The data were high-pass filtered above 0.01 Hz. The motion parameters included roll, yaw, pitch, and x, y, z translations, and were treated as coregressors for all subsequent analyses. \n\n\n#### General Linear Model and Cortical Activation Maps \n  \nWe were interested in stroke-related differences in cortical activity involved in sensorimotor integration during movement. In addition, we are interested in the young and age-matched control differences during this task. As previously shown in  , at the start of the trial the sensory feedback was at its lowest value. On the contrary, the level of wrist motion (not displayed in the figure) was greatest at the start of the search. As the participant closed in on the target, sensory feedback increased. In this latter phase of the task, finer wrist movements were required. Thus, wrist movement was greatest at the start of each trial, and sensory feedback was greatest at the end. In order to identify the brain activity associated with movement, wrist motion was estimated as the absolute change in   θ   with time. However, as mentioned above, the wrist motion parameters throughout time were used as co-regressors to help control for the variation in movement during the earlier and later stages of the task. \n\nThe sensory feedback and wrist movement signals, both produced with our in-house software from the ShapeTape data, were median filtered with a window of 2 s. Using the “waver” function in AFNI, the signals were then convolved with a double-gamma variate hemodynamic response function to produce modeled BOLD responses and resampled to the fMRI temporal resolution of 0.5 Hz. This method was repeated for the auditory, visual, and audiovisual feedback conditions to produce three movement regressors (A , V , AV ) and three sensory feedback regressors (A , V , AV ). Using the 3dDeconvolve program in AFNI, a multilinear regression was performed for each voxel, with the six task-related regressors and six head motion parameters (three rotation, three translation) contributing to the BOLD signal. The marginal   t  -value for the beta coefficient of each task-related regressor was resampled into 1 mm MNI space. These six cortical activation maps were calculated for every stroke participant and age-matched control. \n\n\n#### Within Network Functional Connectivity \n  \nWe were interested in the within network and between network functional connectivity. For the within network functional connectivity, functional connectivity MRI analysis was performed with Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) Version 3.14 available with the FMRIB's Software Library (FSL, RRID:SCR_002823,  ). All runs and the stroke and aged matched control participants were time concatenated for a single 75-run (19 participants and 4 runs) group ICA. The sensory-motor only task run of stroke participant S04 was not included in the analysis since data collection was not complete. The data were high-pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 0.01 Hz ( ). The first five TRs were discarded to exclude signal drifts due to system ramp-up. This left each run with 175 volumes over 350 s. The functional image volumes were motion corrected using the MCFLIRT implementation ( ). Slice-time correction was applied using linear interpolation. Skull-stripping was automatically performed with the brain extraction tool (BET) ( ), and the data were spatially smoothed with a 5 mm full-width half-max Gaussian kernel. The skull stripped images were visually inspected to ensure the quality of the skull stripping. The resulting brain mask was used to exclude non-brain voxels from the remaining analysis. All participants were spatially normalized to an anatomical MNI standard template using a 12-parameter affine registration implemented in FLIRT ( ). The voxel BOLD times series were demeaned, variance normalized, and whitened. \n\nThe number of independent components were estimated using a Bayesian approach described by Minka et al. ( ). Once the independent components for the combined stroke and age matched control data were calculated, a dual regression ( ) was used to estimate individual spatial maps and time courses for each participant and session. Components with vertical stripes in the axial view were associated with motion and excluded from further analysis. Voxel-based general linear modeling was performed between stroke and age-matched controls, and between rest and task conditions for each independent component. The resulting maps of t values were used as representations of the contributions of each condition to the component of interest. The term “within network functional connectivity” was used to refer to this relationship between the group/task and the network component. \n\n\n#### Task-Based Network Identification \n  \nOverall relationships between resting-state networks and the task conditions were estimated with temporal correlation. The BOLD response to each task condition was modeled by convolving the stimulus presentation time signal with a double-gamma hemodynamic response function. The modeled time courses were concatenated across all 19 participants and four runs using the same arrangement used for the time-concatenated group ICA. The relationship between an independent component and the experimental variable was estimated by correlating the spatial component's data time course to the modeled BOLD response of the experimental variable. Since the movement-only and sensory-only conditions were presented in regular 15 s intervals, their modeled time courses were used to identify the functional brain network associated with the task. Shown in  , one particular task-related independent component (SM ) had a high correlation (  r   > 0.9) with the movement-only condition. This component, shown in   below, will be referred to as the active sensorimotor network. \n\n\n#### Between-Network Functional Connectivity Analysis \n  \nIn order to assess the between-network functional connectivity, group ICA network maps were thresholded at a z-score of 30, and local maxima of clusters >2 cm  were treated as nodes for a subsequent seed-based functional connectivity analysis. The z-score threshold and cluster size threshold were chosen heuristically such that only one or two clusters remained for each network. The voxel with the maximum z-score was used from each cluster for seed-based analysis. Shown in  , a total of 27 local maxima were extracted from the left and right sensorimotor networks, the left and right parietofrontal control networks, the default-mode network, the bilateral cerebellar network, the bilateral extrastriate visual network, the primary visual network, the left and right auditory networks, and the bilateral thalamic network. Since the task-fMRI data were also included in the ICA, the left sensorimotor network map contained three clusters. These included the left precentral gyrus, and two clusters within the right cerebellum. The inclusion of task-positive BOLD data also caused the right sensorimotor network's local maximum to occur within the postcentral gyrus. Since the contralesional sensorimotor network has been shown to be involved in motor plasticity after stroke, the nodes from left and right sensorimotor networks were reflected over the mid-sagittal plane to produce 4 additional nodes. Independent components related to motion or cardiac artifact were regressed out of the raw BOLD data. The six motion regressors that were calculated by the MCFLIRT function prior to the group ICA were also used to clean the original BOLD data. The temporal correlation coefficient was calculated from the cleaned BOLD time courses of each pair of seed points. \n  \nLocations used for between network seed-based FC analysis. \n  \n Table of point locations used for seed-based functional connectivity analysis. The network name (i.e., independent component), anatomical region, and MNI coordinates are provided for each seed.

Region abbreviations: (IPL, inferior parietal lobule; aPFC, anterior prefrontal cortex; M1, primary motor cortex; S1, primary sensory cortex; V1, primary visual cortex; A1, primary auditory cortex; V5, middle temporal visual area)  . \n  \n\n\n### Statistical Analyses \n  \n#### Voxel-Based Analysis of BOLD Activation Maps and Spatial Network Maps \n  \nAll spatial map group comparisons were performed in MNI space and corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR correction. Group differences in functional connectivity maps were calculated in a 4 mm resolution MNI space as output by MELODIC. In our AFNI pipeline, we upsampled the BOLD activation maps into 1 mm MNI space before group comparison. Three BOLD activation maps from AFNI and four spatial network maps from the FSL dual regression analysis were compared between groups and conditions by using voxel-based Student's   t  -tests. Since we were focused on sensorimotor function in this study, only the spatial maps of networks included in   were analyzed. Voxel-level Student's   t  -tests were performed to test contrasts between stroke and control groups. In the functional network maps, additional paired   t  -tests were performed to determine within-group contrasts between resting-state and search. Spatial clusters of significantly different voxels (  p   < 0.01) were identified. In order to account for multiple comparisons, a corrected alpha value of 0.05 was used to remove clusters less than a threshold size determined by 3dClustSim tool in AFNI. 3dClustSim, which corrects for multiple comparisons using FDR correction, was applied to both 4 mm and 1 mm MNI space templates to estimate cluster size thresholds for FDR correction. The cluster size threshold was 359 voxels for the 1 mm BOLD contrasts from AFNI and 8 voxels for the 4 mm functional connectivity maps from MELODIC. Multiple comparisons correction was further applied for the number of contrasts performed (3 activation maps and 20 functional networks). For between-network connectivity, a Student's   t  -test with was performed between stroke participants and age-matched controls for the edge strength between each pair of seed points. Multiple comparisons FWE correction was applied for the number of pairwise   t  -tests, which was (n (n-1)/2) = (27 26/2) = 702. \n\n\n#### Correlational Analysis With Clinical Functional Scores \n  \nWe hypothesized that stroke-related differences in task-related BOLD activation and functional network spatial maps would be correlated with the clinical evaluations of sensorimotor impairment/function. A linear regression analysis was performed with each BOLD activation contrast and functional network maps as a predictor of the Box and Blocks Score for the impaired arm. No linear regressions were performed with our activation and connectivity measures and the Fugl-Meyer or the Wolf Motor scores because there was a ceiling effect in our stroke participants with the Fugl-Meyer upper extremity ( ), and the Wolf Motor correlated with the Fugl-Meyer (R = 0.87). The independent components that were compared between groups included the left and right sensorimotor networks. The   p  -values were multiplied by the number of analyzed networks to correct for multiple comparisons. \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### The Search Task Produced Cortical Activation Patterns Within Motor and Multisensory Integration Areas \n  \n demonstrates that in young healthy individuals and in the age-matched control group, our search task successfully produced unique cortical activation patterns for different sensory feedback conditions. Activity is reported where the group mean is significantly positive (  t   > 2.79,   p   < 0.01, corrected). Search task-related activation common to all conditions was detected in contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, bilateral somatosensory association cortex, and bilateral anterior cerebellum. Purely visual or auditory activity was found in the primary visual and auditory cortices. An inferior-to-superior spatial gradient in overlapping activation maps were seen along the bilateral occipital surface. The superior occipital gyrus activity was exclusive to the unimodal auditory feedback condition. The middle occipital gyrus responded to the auditory and audiovisual conditions. \n  \nSearch-task BOLD activation maps in healthy individuals. These activations were produced from the novel search task paradigm. Mean BOLD activation for the auditory (A ), visual (V ), and audiovisual (AV ) task conditions in   (A)   the young healthy adult group and   (B)   the control group age-matched to the stroke survivors. Note the BOLD contrasts are shown for the movement regressors. \n  \nIn young adults, there was unique activation during the audiovisual feedback condition within the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral posterior parietal cortex, corresponding to the anterior and posterior multimodal association areas. BOLD activation in the control group that was age-matched to the stroke survivors was similar with the young healthy adults. However, this group did not have unique activation within the prefrontal and posterior parietal areas.   illiterates stroke activity and the difference between stroke and control. \n\n\n### During Sensory-Guided Movement, BOLD Activation in Stroke Survivors Depends on Sensory Feedback Modality \n  \nAs demonstrated in   and  , the BOLD activation in stroke survivors was dependent on the modality of sensory feedback. First, in the visual search condition, stroke survivors had similar activation to the age-matched controls within the active contralateral sensorimotor cortex. There was an increased activation in the contralesional prefrontal, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortices (  p   < 0.01, corrected). Increased activation was also observed within the ipsilesional prefrontal cortex (  p   < 0.01, corrected). Second, overall BOLD activity in stroke participants was lower than controls during the auditory feedback condition. Thirdly, the task-related BOLD activity in stroke survivors during the audiovisual search condition was significantly different from the age-matched controls in the contralesional inferior occipital gyrus and the posterior thalamic radiation. During the visual and the audiovisual search, contralesional regions positively correlated with the Box and Blocks score, with the exception of the superior temporal gyrus ( ). In the visual search task, the contralesional middle occipital gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus correlated with the Box and Blocks score; similarly, the inferior occipital and the posterior thalamic radiation correlated with the Box and Blocks score during the audiovisual task. As mentioned, the audio search task had decreased BOLD activity in the stroke group as compared to the controls, and these bilateral decreases were positively correlated with the Box and Blocks score. \n  \nBOLD activation maps of stroke vs. controls. BOLD activation in visual, auditory, and audiovisual sensory guided movement. Group-averaged activity and significant differences (  p   < 0.01, un-corrected) are shown in stroke survivors (  n   = 10) and controls (  n   = 9) on inflated brain surfaces. The three sensory feedback conditions had similar activation in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, and bilateral somatosensory association cortex. Stroke participants had greater contralesional activation than controls during the visual condition and less ipsilesional activity during the auditory condition. The contralateral (ipsilesional) side is depicted on the left, and the ipsilateral (contralesional) side is depicted on the right. \n    \nLocalized group differences in BOLD activation. \n  \n Clusters surviving FDR correction are marked in bold font.

This network included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortex, and ipsilateral cerebellum, which had the highest temporal correlation with the modeled BOLD response (R = 0.716 across all participants). During both rest and the search task, this movement-related network was similar between stroke participants and age-matched controls. In controls, the participation of sensorimotor cortices became lateralized during the “search” task. Both hemispheres contributed to this shift in laterality, with greater positivity in contralateral sensorimotor areas and negative coefficients in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex. There was also an increased bilateral contribution from the supplementary motor area. These task-related network changes were not seen in stroke participants. Rather, contralateral somatosensory cortex and ipsilateral SMA and ventromedial premotor cortex increased in network participation. Thus, stroke participants had greater within-network participation in the ipsilateral hemisphere during the search task. This result also held after subtracting the resting-state network values. \n  \nWithin network functional connectivity: stroke vs. control functional network maps.

The resting-state functional connectivity between left and right sensorimotor networks was lower (  p   < 0.05, corrected) in the stroke group. During both the task and resting state, functional connectivity in stroke participants showed an increase in connectivity between the sensorimotor areas and the visual areas in the occipital lobe as shown in  . During the “search” task the left and right parietofrontal networks demonstrated lower between-network functional connectivity, both between the parietofrontal areas and the rest of the networks. Connections to the cerebellum ( ) were also lower in participants with stroke. \n  \nGroup differences in between network functional connectivity. An inflated pial surface of a template brain is shown with color-coded independent components and functional network graph overlay. The ipsilesional side is depicted on the left, contralesional on the right. Stroke-related increased connections are in red and decreases are in cyan. The overhead view in   (A)   shows the connectivity to the left and right sensorimotor network nodes and in   (B)   presents connectivity to the bilateral parietofrontal networks.   (C)   The posterior views show connectivity differences to four   (C)   sensorimotor network nodes, and   (D)   eight cerebellar nodes. Note that all nodes are within brain tissue, although some of the network edges are difficult to visualize. \n  \n\n### Decreased Task-Based Functional Connectivity With the Cerebellum During Sensorimotor Integration Correlates With Motor Impairment After Stroke \n  \n shows that with the “search” task, decreases in network functional connectivity of the cerebellum and visual association areas were associated with Box and Blocks score in individuals with stroke. In stroke participants, the contralesional cerebellum had decreased functional connectivity with the active sensorimotor cortex as previously mentioned ( ;   p   < 0.005, corrected). As shown in  , this cortico-cerebellar connectivity was significantly and positively correlated with Box and Blocks score (  r   = 0.64). Also, the connectivity of right and left extrastriate cortical regions (V5) measured during the search task were significantly and positively correlated with Box and Blocks score (  r   = 0.82). There were no significant correlations between resting state functional connectivity and the Box and Blocks score. \n  \nFunctional trends in seed-based functional connectivity. Differences in functional connectivity in individual stroke survivors during the search task vary with Box and Blocks Score (colored number indicated on top of each brain). Note that the   z  -score is calculated as the difference in connectivity strength between the age-matched controls and the individual stroke participant. The ipsilesional side is depicted on the left, contralesional on the right. Note that all nodes are within brain tissue, although some areas in the cerebellum are difficult to visualize with this slice. \n    \nScatterplots of seed-based connectivity during “search” task vs. motor function. Stroke participants are shown with black dots and controls are shown with blue triangles. The dependent variable in each plot is the partial correlation between two specified seed points. Linear regressions were performed within stroke participants and repeated across all participants (assuming that controls scored a 76). The first   r   and P  are the coefficient of variation and slope's   p  -value for the regression analysis across all participants. The second   r   and P  are associated with the analysis that included only stroke survivors. Group differences are reported by   t  -value and corresponding   P  -value. The figure shows the Box and blocks correlation with   (A)   Left M1 & Right M1 connectivity,   (B)   Left M1 & Right Crus-V1 connectivity,   (C)   Left IFS & Right IFS connectivity, and   (D)   Left V5 & Right V5 connectivity. \n  \n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study provides several novel findings that advance our understanding of network function of the brain after stroke. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the search task activated different parts of the brain dependent on visual, auditory, or audiovisual cues. For instance, in order to complete the visual search task control participants used greater contralateral activation, while stroke participants used greater ipsilateral activation. The connectivity analysis of the search task revealed more stroke-related deficits as compared to resting state. Of particular interest, we found a stroke-related increase in functional connectivity between the sensorimotor and visual areas only during the search task (not resting state), suggesting stroke survivors might rely more on visual feedback for motor control. The dependence of hand function on cerebellar and sensorimotor connectivity was only detected during the search task, indicative of the importance of performing task-based functional connectivity. \n\n### Multisensory Control in Wrist Movement Evokes Activation in Bilateral Motor and Association Areas \n  \nThe activation patterns seen in the neurologically intact control group revealed that wrist movement during single and multisensory search tasks elicits activation patterns mainly in the contralateral sensorimotor, and the bilateral premotor and somatosensory association cortices ( ). As expected, the visual feedback task produced additional activation in the occipital lobe ( – ), while the auditory feedback produced activation in the temporal and superior occipital gyrus ( – ). Interestingly, the combined audiovisual condition in young adults also recruited areas in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral posterior parietal cortex. Similarly, the within-network and between-network functional connectivity also suggests that the complex search task used in the current study connects motor and association areas bilaterally, which contrasts to the lateralized contralateral activation seen in finger tapping fMRI protocols ( ,  ). This is notable in  , where the independent component network with the highest temporal correlation with the recorded movement during the search tasks included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, the bilateral premotor cortex, and the ipsilateral cerebellum (not visible in figure). Our study shows that a search task paradigm reveals the effects of multimodal sensory feedback on brain functional networks in neurologically intact participants, providing evidence that single-joint movement during multisensory control recruits areas of the brain beyond contralateral motor regions. \n\nBrain activation was sensitive to the search task fMRI paradigm in stroke participants. As seen in  , stroke participants' task-related activation was dependent on the type of sensory feedback. Stroke participants had increased activation in the bilateral prefrontal cortex, and contralesional posterior parietal and sensorimotor cortices during the visual search condition. During auditory feedback, stroke participants had reduced ipsilesional activity. In the combined audiovisual search task, activation of the inferior occipital and the posterior temporal gyri was significantly reduced in stroke, and activation of these regions positively correlated with the Box and Blocks score ( ). These results suggest that task-related activation is sensory-dependent, and that multisensory integration is impacted by stroke ( ). \n\nFunctional connectivity was also dependent on the search task in the current study. The within-network functional connectivity results suggest that stroke participants engage bilateral motor regions to a higher extent to complete the search task.   shows that the functional connectivity within the ipsilateral sensorimotor network was greater during the search task as compared to rest in stroke participants. Whereas, the sensorimotor cortices in the neurologically intact group became more lateralized toward the contralateral hemisphere, the stroke group had greater within network participation in the ipsilateral hemisphere during the search task, suggesting that stroke participants engage bilateral motor networks during a search task and wrist movement. This observation is consistent with prior reports on brain activation ( ,  ,  ). \n\n\n### Task-Based Functional Connectivity Provides Unique Information About Sensorimotor Integration and Motor Control After Stroke \n  \nConsistent with our hypothesis, the search task revealed “local specialization” as evidenced by increased within-network functional connectivity, and greater between-network connectivity after stroke. The control group saw an increase in within-network connectivity in the contralateral sensorimotor areas and bilateral SMA ( ). As shown in  , cortical areas within the ipsilateral sensorimotor network were lower during the search task in control participants, further suggesting task-related inhibition of the ipsilateral cortex in healthy individuals and lateralization toward the contralateral hemisphere ( ). The increase in bilateral SMA contributions to the sensorimotor network with the task might be due to the strong reciprocal connections between the left and right SM ( ). In contrast, the stroke group saw increased within network connectivity in the ipsilateral SMA and ventromedial premotor areas during the search task ( ). Due to lesion location in the contralateral hemisphere, stroke participants were unlikely to be able to increase contralateral cortical participation in the SM network with the task. Thus, the stroke group appeared to produce local reorganization in the ipsilateral side. \n\nThe task-based fMRI revealed stroke-related network connectivity changes that positively correlated with motor impairment ( ). The resting-state functional connectivity between left and right sensorimotor networks was lower (  p   < 0.05) in the stroke group, which is consistent with other reports of decreased interhemispheric connectivity after stroke ( ); however, these changes were not correlated with the box and blocks scores ( ). During the “search” task, reduced functional connectivity between the left and right V5 was strongly correlated with the box and blocks score in stroke individuals ( ). Additionally, the functional connectivity between the middle temporal gyrus and parietofrontal nodes showed stroke-related increases ( ). The middle temporal gyrus has been shown to play a role in processing motion-related visual information ( ). \n\n\n### Clinical Correlations During the Search Task Reveal Sensorimotor Integration Deficits in Stroke \n  \nA unique finding in this study is a stroke-related increase in functional connectivity between the sensorimotor and visual areas during a search task, suggesting that stroke survivors may rely on visual feedback for motor control. During the auditory feedback conditions, stroke participant's auditory cortex was less active ( ;  ). In contrast, ipsilesional cortical activity was more widespread in stroke participants than controls during the visuomotor task. While auditory feedback has been shown to improve weight bearing and gait characteristics in stroke survivors ( ), individuals with stroke have been shown to rely on visual feedback for posturing ( ). Additionally, visual feedback during grip-force control increases activation in the visual cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor areas, and the ipsilateral cerebellum in stroke participants ( ), and limb apraxia has been associated with a deficit in visuo-motor integration due to lesions in the fronto-parietal motor network ( ). The findings suggest that visual information during a complex motor task is an important source of feedback in stroke survivors and highlights the importance of measuring brain activation and calculating between-network connectivity during task-state fMRI. \n\nAlthough the results showed an effect during visual feedback that was not present during the auditory condition, it would be overreaching to conclude that stroke survivors are more sensitive to visual over auditory feedback during fine-motor control. We do not know the visual vs. auditory sensitivity in each subject, which is information that would require a psychophysical exam. Although we did not record the dB gain of the maximum auditory feedback, a reasonable volume was used during the experiment. The volume was set such that the subject reported that the auditory feedback could be heard. \n\nIn addition to identifying stroke participant's dependence on visual feedback for motor control, this work emphasized the importance of cerebellar functional connectivity after stroke, specifically during sensorimotor integration. As indicated in  , the bilateral cerebellum exhibited stroke-related decreases in functional connectivity during both at rest and during the search task. Additionally, the connectivity between the ipsilateral cerebellar crus VI and the contralateral M1 was positively correlated with the box and blocks score when tested using the search task ( ). Involvement of the cerebellum in different networks involving movement and multisensory integration give it a critical role in brain plasticity after stroke ( ). The motor cortex and cerebellum together have been shown to be involved in plasticity during motor training and in sensorimotor integration ( ). Past imaging studies have shown that the connectivity between the cerebellum and parietofrontal areas are related to post-stroke motor function ( ,  ). \n\n\n### Study Limitations \n  \nThis study is limited by its small sample size for each group, especially for the age matched control and stroke participants. Head motion is a potential confounding factor in any study using functional activity or connectivity MRI, especially those involving task-based paradigms and patient populations. Indeed, head motion has been found in past studies to be greater in patients than in controls, and also increases with age ( ). Van Dijk et al. found that although most variability in functional connectivity is not associated with head movement, there is significantly reduced functional coupling between the parietofrontal and default-mode network nodes in young adults. Furthermore, greater mean head motion leads to increased local functional coupling and interhemispheric connectivity between sensorimotor areas. Stroke participants in this study had significantly greater mean head motion than controls (  p   < 0.05) at rest and during the search task. Thus, our findings that stroke survivors had decreased between-network connectivity to the bilateral parietofrontal networks and increased within-network connectivity contralesionally could be in part due to increased head motion. However, we observed decreased interhemispheric connectivity, opposite to what was observed by Van Dijk et al. Since head motion was regressed out of the original data before our seed-based analysis, we do not believe that it was the prime contributor to our findings. \n\nChanges in vasculature after stroke can lead to differences in neurovascular coupling near the lesion, which may influence correlations of these voxels with distant areas. Differences in brain structure can have an impact on functional connectivity metrics due to changes in the partial volume of gray matter ( ). Using simulations, Dukart and Bertolino showed that between-group differences in brain structure leads to significant differences in functional connectivity between the groups. Due to the large variability in lesion location in this study, partial volume was not expected to have a significant impact on functional connectivity results. \n\nNon-stroke related lateralization of cortical activation and functional connectivity is a potential confounding factor in this study. Studies of healthy adults have shown significant lateralization of resting-state functional connectivity ( ). Nielson et al. showed that there are 20 “lateralization hubs” that have the most lateralized functional connectivity. Some of these hubs included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, Broca's area, insula, and junctions between the parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Many of these regions are unimodal and multimodal sensory association areas. Handedness of our participants and the procedures of flipping the brain over the mid-sagittal plane to place all lesions on the same side of the brain could have had an impact on the results. \n\nSpatial group differences in BOLD contrasts and functional connectivity could have been affected by group differences in the level of head motion during the task. The fsl_motion_outliers program in the FMRIB Software Library was used to estimate mean frame-wise displacement (FD) and mean square of successive differences (DVARS) ( ) from the BOLD data during the search task runs of each subject. Shown in  , both metrics of head motion were significantly different (  p   < 0.01) between groups, but neither DVARS (r2 = 0.02) nor FD (r2 = 0.08) were correlated with Box and Blocks score. Although head motion regressors were included in all fMRI analyses in this study, greater motion in stroke subjects may have reduced the peak values of the functional connectivity maps. \n\nDifferences between study groups in range of wrist movement, and task performance could also impact the interpretation of our imaging findings. We report the number of completed search-task trials as a rough estimate of performance in  . On average, stroke subjects completed 49.4 trials, which was significantly (  p   < 0.01) >61.1 trials completed in age-matched controls. However, the number of completed trials did not correlate (r2 = 0.04) with the Box and Blocks score. Shown in  , the number of search trials ( ) and the average error accumulated ( ) was not correlated with the box and blocks scores. Shown in  , the range of wrist motion was not significantly different between groups nor correlated with Box and Blocks score in stroke subjects. \n\n\n\n## Conclusion \n  \nIn conclusion, our novel functional MRI task paradigm involving wrist movement and multisensory feedback revealed changes in BOLD activation and functional connectivity after stroke, suggesting that task-based fMRI can highlight alterations in brain functional networks after stroke. We documented widespread bilateral activation in neurologically intact participants during an audiovisual search task, indicating that multisensory wrist control recruits primary motor and association areas. In contrast, stroke participant's activation patterns were task dependent; visual feedback produced increased contralesional activation compared to controls, while auditory feedback resulted in decreased activation ipsilesionally. Additionally, our within-network functional connectivity analysis detected a task-related lateralization to contralateral sensorimotor regions in control participants that was not found in stroke. Lastly, between-network functional connectivity during the search task revealed decreased connectivity between the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex and the contralesional cerebellum, and between interhemispheric V5 regions, which both correlated with box and blocks scores of hand function. These results suggest that task-based functional connectivity provides detail on changes in brain networks in stroke survivors. The data also highlight the importance of cerebellar connections for recovery of arm function after stroke. Future work will investigate the role of structural connectivity in these mechanistic changes between sensorimotor and sensory integration networks. \n\n\n## Data Availability \n  \nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher. \n\n\n## Ethics Statement \n  \nThis study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Institutional Review Boards of the Medical College of Wisconsin and Marquette University with written informed consent from all subjects.

WM encoding and WM retrieval have not been investigated in schizophrenia without the confounds of illness chronicity or the use of antipsychotics and illicit substances.

Sixty-six volunteers (35 controls, 31 drug-free patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder) completed the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm during an fMRI scan. Neural activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval was indexed using the blood-oxygen-level-dependent hemodynamic response. A subset of volunteers (20 controls, 20 drug-free patients) underwent a dynamic PET scan to measure [ C] MePPEP distribution volume (ml/cm ) to index CB1R availability. In a whole-brain analysis, there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the superior parietal lobule during WM encoding, and the bilateral hippocampus during WM retrieval. Region of interest analyses in volunteers who had PET/fMRI indicated that there was a significant main effect of group on task-related BOLD responses in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC, left ACC during encoding; and in the bilateral hippocampus, striatum, ACC and right DLPFC during retrieval. Striatal CB1R availability was positively associated with mean striatal activation during WM retrieval in male patients (  R   = 0.5,   p   = 0.02) but not male controls (  R   = −0.20,   p   = 0.53), and this was significantly different between groups,   Z   = −2.20,   p   = 0.02. Striatal CB1R may contribute to the pathophysiology of WM deficits in male patients and have implications for drug development in schizophrenia. \n \n\n# Body\n \n## Introduction \n  \nVerbal working memory (WM) deficits are a stable component of the cognitive deficit seen in schizophrenia [ ] that predict poor clinical [ ] and functional outcomes [ ]. However, the neurobiology underlying WM impairments remains poorly understood and unaddressed by current treatments [ ]. Identifying the pathophysiology underlying impairments in WM is therefore important for the development of pharmacological treatments targeting WM deficits in schizophrenia. \n\nWM, the temporary storage and manipulation of information, is comprised of distinct processes including encoding, maintenance and retrieval [ ]. Studies using the Sternberg Item-Recognition paradigm (SIRP), able to disentangle the effects of WM encoding and WM retrieval, have shown that healthy volunteers show greater task-dependent blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses during WM encoding in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, left hippocampus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral parietal cortex; and greater BOLD signal during WM retrieval in the bilateral parietal cortex, bilateral ttemporal cortex and the posterior cingulate [ ]. \n\nWhile numerous studies have investigated WM in schizophrenia [ ], few studies have used paradigms that are able to investigate WM encoding and retrieval mechanisms separately [ – ], and those that have, typically fail to model them separately [ – ] or do not report findings for both WM encoding and retrieval [ ]. While one study investigated WM encoding and retrieval in anti-psychotic-treated, male patients with chronic schizophrenia [ ], groups were not matched on performance. \n\nIn this context, anti-psychotic treated patients relative to controls showed lower activation during WM encoding in the inferior and middle frontal gyri, but greater activation during WM retrieval in the left hippocampus, left striatum and the right inferior and frontal gyri [ ]. However, it is unclear if group differences [ ] may be related to the effects of anti-psychotic medication, substance use, illness chronicity or poor task engagement. \n\nMice deficient in cannabinoid 1 receptors (CB1Rs) on GABAergic interneurons exhibit WM deficits [ ]. Moreover, alterations in peripheral CB1R mRNA levels have been associated with poor cognitive performance [ ]. We recently showed that patients with schizophrenia show fewer cortical CB1Rs, where lower levels are associated with poorer cognitive functioning [ ]. Moreover, medication-naïve FEP patients, who do not use cannabis, show greater levels of the endogenous CB1R agonist, anandamide [ ], shown to impair memory retrieval in rodents [ – ]. \n\nWe aimed to investigate the neural basis of both WM encoding and WM retrieval, and their relationship to CB1R availability. We predicted that patients relative to controls would show lower CB1R availability [ ,  ] and altered functional activation during WM encoding and WM retrieval [ ]. Taking together findings that CB1R modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity underlying memory [ – ] and literature showing an association between CB1R availability and behavioural measures of cognition in schizophrenia [ ], we predicted that CB1R availability would be associated with the neural correlates of WM. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Design \n  \nA cross-sectional design was used. The neural correlates of WM were investigated in males and females, as well as males alone. Due to sex differences in CB1Rs [ ], we investigated CB1Rs in males, with the view of investigating females in future. The PET data, but not the fMRI or PET-fMRI relationships, were recently reported [ ]. \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nSixty-six volunteers including 31 patients with drug-naïve/free first episode psychosis (FEP) (mean [SD], age, 26.64 [4.68] years; 26 males, 5 females) and 35 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 27.12, [5.32] years; 26 males, 9 females) matched on age (age ±3 years) and sex were included. Patients were recruited from early intervention services for psychosis and healthy volunteers were recruited via local advertising in London, United Kingdom. A power calculation indicated that a sample size of 20 volunteers per group would have >80% power to detect a relationship of   R   = 0.35,   p   < 0.05 (two-tailed) (see supplementary for full details). \n\n\n### Inclusion and exclusion criteria \n  \nPatients met the following criteria: (1) <3 years of illness onset; (2) mental capacity to consent; and (3) diagnosis of schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder [ ]. Healthy volunteers met the following criteria: (1) no current/lifetime history of an Axis I disorder, as determined by the Structured Clinical Interview of DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders (SCID) [ ]; (2) and no family history (first/second-degree) of an Axis I disorder [ ]. \n\nExclusion criteria for all volunteers were as follows: (1) current/lifetime history of substance abuse/dependence, as determined by the SCID [ ]; (2) substance use within the last month; (3) positive result on a urine toxicology test detecting THC metabolites for up to 30 days (50 ng/ml cut off) or a positive result on a test detecting cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis, opiates and benzodiazepines; (4) head injury leading to loss of consciousness; and (5) contraindications to MRI safety. \n\n\n### Measures \n  \n#### Clinical and demographic variables \n  \nAge, sex, ethnicity, current/previous alcohol, nicotine and illicit substance use, age of illness onset/duration were recorded. Clinical symptom severity was determined using the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS) [ ]. \n\n\n#### Neuroimaging \n  \n##### Sternberg Item-Recognition Paradigm (SIRP) \n  \nHigh-resolution T1-weighted images and the SIRP were acquired on a General Electric MR750 3.0 tesla scanner (see supplementary materials for neuroimaging acquisition parameters). The SIRP, shown to have good reliability [ ], was used to investigate WM [ ]. The task comprised of (1) encoding trials, where volunteers were instructed to memorize sets of letters; (2) retrieval trials, where volunteers indicated whether they had seen the letters previously; and (3) rest trials (see supplementary materials for details and Supplementary Fig.   for a paradigm schematic). \n\n\n##### Cannabinoid 1 receptor availability \n  \nAs reported elsewhere [ ], a CB1-selective radiotracer, [ C]MePPEP using arterial blood sampling, was used to measure CB1R availability [ ] (see supplementary materials for neuroimaging acquisition parameters). \n\n\n\n\n### Statistical analyses \n  \nStatistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; Version 22) [ ]. Data normality was assessed using the Shapiro−Wilk test; and equality of variances were assessed using the Lavene’s test. \n\n#### Behavioural data analysis \n  \nGroup differences in categorical and continuous variables were determined using chi-square and independent samples   t   tests, respectively. \n\n\n#### fMRI analysis \n  \nData were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM-12; Version 6684) [ ] using Matlab 8.5 [ ]. Frame-wise displacement was calculated used methods described previously [ ]. High velocity motion spikes were regressed out by including scan nulling (censoring) regressors for volumes with volume-to-volume frame-wise displacement greater than 0.5 mm. A standard pre-processing pipeline was implemented (see supplementary materials for methods). The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was modelled using an event-related design where a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) was convolved with regressors encoding the onset and duration for the following ten conditions: encoding load (EL) 1, EL 3, EL 5, EL 7, EL 9, retrieval load (RL) 1, RL 3, RL 5, RL 7, and RL 9. Rest trials were left un-modelled and served as an implicit baseline. Individual fixed-effects analyses were performed for each participant to identify regional differences in relative activation using the following linear contrasts of parameter estimates: EL 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1 and RL 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1. To investigate group differences in the neural correlates of WM, a 2 (group: patient vs. control) × 4 (load: 3-1, 5-1, 7-1 and 9-1) ANOVA was conducted for encoding and retrieval, respectively, controlling for age, sex and mean frame-wise displacement. Independent samples   t   tests were also used to investigate group differences in (1) mean frame-wise displacement and (2) task response accuracy (% of overall correct responses). \n\nWhole-brain analyses were conducted using the full sample (  N   = 66) including males and females, as well as males only (  N   = 52). Whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) analyses were repeated in male volunteers (  N   = 40) who had PET/fMRI, in order to permit the investigation of the association between CB1R and the neural correlates of WM in the same volunteers. ROI analyses were conducted for the ACC, hippocampus and striatum, defined using a standard probabilistic atlas [ ]. Since this atlas [ ] does not include the DLPFC, ROI analyses conducted for the DLPFC were defined using Brodmann areas 9 and 46 [ ] using the WFU PickAtlas Toolbox ( ). These ROIs were selected based on findings that WM encoding activates the bilateral ACC, striatum, hippocampus and DLPFC in controls [ ] and findings indicating that CB1R agonists administered to the striatum [ ,  ], hippocampus [ ,  ] and medial prefrontal cortex impair memory in rodents [ ]. \n\nA result was deemed significant if it survived family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of the peak-level extent (pFWE < 0.05). Mean BOLD signal was extracted using the MarsBar toolbox ( ) using independently derived ROIs [ ]. Mean BOLD signal for encoding and retrieval trials were extracted for whole-brain grey matter, defined using the WFU PickAtlas Toolbox ( ) in order to investigate data normality and equality of variances. \n\n\n#### PET analysis \n  \nA standard pre-processing pipeline was implemented (see supplementary materials for methods). CB1R availability was indexed using the distribution volume (  V  ) of [ C]MePPEP using the Logan graphical method with a metabolite-free arterial plasma input function [ ]. CB1R availability was investigated in the same ROIs that were used for the fMRI ROI analyses. A 2 (group) × 4 (region: DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus, striatum) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to investigate group differences in CB1R availability. \n\n\n#### PET and fMRI analyses \n  \nPearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the association between CB1R availability and (1) performance accuracy; and (2) the linearity of the load-dependence of the BOLD response during WM encoding and WM retrieval (for each subject, we fitted a linear regression model (intercept and slope) and took the slope as our measure of linearity of the BOLD response, as a function of task difficulty (separately for encoding and retrieval)). Bonferroni corrections were applied. Levels of statistical significance were   p   < 0.05 for all tests (two-tailed). \n\n\n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Demographic and clinical data \n  \nAll data were normally distributed. There were no group differences in age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, years of education, body mass index, current cannabis, alcohol or tobacco use (see Table  ).   \nSample clinical and demographic characteristics showing that there were no group differences between healthy volunteers and first episode psychosis patients in age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, body mass index, cannabis, alcohol or tobacco use. \n  \n N   sample size,   SCZ   schizophrenia,   SCZA   schizoaffective disorder,   PANSS   Positive and Negative Syndrome scale,   t   (independent samples   t  -test),   x   (chi-square test), degrees of freedom (  df  ),   NA   not applicable,   SD   standard deviation \n\nYears of education: calculated as the years of education after compulsory education (minimum compulsory education in the United Kingdom is 12 years) \n\nSocio-economic status: High = high, intermediate and lower grade professionals; medium = small employer, self-employed and lower technical occupations; low = sales, routine occupations, unemployed; student = student \n  \n\n\n### Sternberg Item-Recognition fMRI Paradigm \n  \n#### Performance \n  \nThere were no significant group differences in performance accuracy on load 1 (t(64) = 1.44,   p   = 0.15) or 7 (t(64) = 1.95,   p   = 0.06) but there were group differences on loads 3 (t(64) = 2.32,   p   = 0.024), 5 (t(64) = 2.69,   p   = 0.01) and 9 (t(64) = 2.70,   p   = 0.01). These findings did not survive Bonferroni corrections. Relative to controls (M = 0.14 mm; SD = 0.07), patients (M = 0.21 mm; SD = 0.17) showed greater total frame-wise displacement (t(64) = −2.12,   p   = 0.04). \n\n\n#### fMRI analyses \n  \n##### Data normality and equality of variance \n  \nAll fMRI data were normally distributed. There were no differences in the variances for fMRI data between groups (see supplementary table  ). \n\n\n##### Encoding \n  \nIn a whole-brain analysis of encoding trials (35 controls, 31 patients), there was a significant main effect of group in the left angular gyrus, left superior parietal lobe; and a significant main effect of WM load in the lingual gyrus and the posterior cingulate gyrus (see Supplementary Table  ). These findings remained unchanged when restricting the analysis to male volunteers (26 controls, 26 patients) (see Supplementary Table  ). \n\nIn a whole-brain analysis of encoding trials (PET-fMRI subset), there was a significant main effect of group in the right middle temporal gyrus and frontal gyrus; and a significant main effect of WM load in the left superior parietal gyrus and the left middle frontal gyrus (see Supplementary Table  ). In ROI analyses of encoding trials, there was a significant main effect of group in the right hippocampus, left DLPFC and the left ACC; and a significant main effect of WM load in the left striatum, bilateral DLPFC and the bilateral ACC (see Table   for full results).   \nRegion of interest analysis of the effects of working memory encoding and working memory retrieval in all male healthy volunteers (  N   = 20) and male patients with first episode psychosis (  N   = 20) who had PET and fMRI when controlling for age, sex and frame-wise displacement. \n  \n H   hemisphere,   L   left,   R   right,   MNI   Montreal Neurological Institute,   CS   cluster size,   p  *   p   value surviving family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of peak-level extent \n  \n\n\n##### Retrieval \n  \nIn a whole-brain analysis of retrieval trials (35 controls, 31 patients), there was a significant main effect of group in the bilateral hippocampus and the left posterior cingulate (see Supplementary Table  ). These findings remained unchanged when restricting the analysis to male volunteers (26 controls, 26 patients) (see Supplementary Table  ). In a whole-brain analysis of retrieval trials (PET-fMRI subset), there was a significant main effect of group in the left hippocampus, bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, bilateral putamen, right anterior cingulate gyrus and the left caudate (see Supplementary Table  ). In ROI analyses of retrieval trials, there was a significant main effect of group in the bilateral striatum (see Fig.  ), bilateral hippocampus, right DLPFC and bilateral ACC (see Table   for results).    Statistical parametric maps showing that a main effect of group in the striatum during working memory in first episode psychosis patients relative to healthy volunteers ((MNI coordinates:   x   = 30,   y   = 2,   z   = −8); F =  34.32,   Z   = 5.43, cluster size = 201,   p   < 0.001).  \nThese findings survived family-wise error (FWE) correction on the basis of the peak-level extent (pFWE < 0.05). The colour bar shows the   t   statistic. \n  \n\n\n\n\n### CB1R availability \n  \nData were normally distributed. There was no difference in the variances between groups (see Supplementary Table  ). In a 2 (group) × 4 (region: DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus, striatum) repeated measures ANOVA, there was a significant effect of group (F(1,38) = 4.61,   p   = 0.03) and region (F(1,38) = 27.43,   p   < 0.001). However, the group × load interaction was not significant (F(1,38) = 0.47,   p   = 0.50). \n\n\n### Association between CB1R availability and working memory \n  \nThere were no significant associations between performance accuracy and CB1R availability (see supplementary materials). However, male patients showed a significant positive association between striatal CB1R availability (see Fig.  ) and mean linear load-dependent responses of striatal BOLD signal during WM retrieval (  R   = 0.50,   p   = 0.02; see Figs.  – ) but male controls did not (  R   = −0.15,   p   = 0.53). However, neither of these findings survived Bonferroni corrections. The association in patients remained significant, when controlling for mean performance accuracy (  R   = 0.39,   p   = 0.04). However, this association fell short of statistical significance (  p   = 0.05) when restricting the analysis to volunteers who had PET and MRI scans <10 days apart (see supplementary materials). There were no other significant associations (see Supplementary Tables  –  for full results).    Statistical parametric maps showing that cannabinoid 1 receptor availability, as determined by the distribution volume of [ C] MePPEP, is significantly lower in the striatum in patients relative to controls.  \nResults are show using a height threshold   p   < 0.05 for visualization purposes. The colour bar shows the   t   statistic. \n     The associtation between striatal CB1R availability and the striatal neural correlates of working memory retrieval.  \n a   Association between the distribution volume of [ C]MePPEP in the striatum (ml/cm ) and mean load-dependent striatal BOLD signal during WM retrieval (beta values) during working memory in the striatum in healthy volunteers and   b   patients with first episode psychosis. A Fisher   r  -to-  z   transformation indicated that these relationships were significantly different between groups,   Z   = −2.20,   p   = 0.02 (two-tailed). \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nOur main finding was that male patients relative to male controls showed altered functional activation during WM encoding in the DLPFC, ACC and hippocampus and altered functional activation during WM retrieval in the DLPFC, ACC, hippocampus and striatum. Interestingly, the same male patients showed fewer cannabinoid 1 receptor levels in these brain regions relative to healthy volunteers. Moreover, male patients showed a positive association between striatal CB1R availability and load-dependent functional activation in the striatum during WM retrieval. \n\nConsistent with previous literature [ ], WM encoding was associated with greater task-related BOLD responses in the hippocampus and striatum. However, our finding that controls showed greater striatal and hippocampal activation during WM retrieval was not shown previously [ ]. Instead, greater task-related BOLD responses during WM retrieval in the parietal, temporal and cingulate cortices have been reported in controls [ ]. Since we used peak-level thresholding, this discrepant finding may be explained by the use of cluster-extent thresholding in this previous study, shown to have poor spatial specificity and increase false positive rates [ ]. \n\nOur finding that patients showed greater activation during WM retrieval in the left hippocampus and the left caudate in drug-free patients is consistent with findings in anti-psychotic-treated, chronic male patients [ ]. However, our finding extends this work by showing that drug-free/naïve FEP patients show altered activation during WM retrieval. Although our finding that patients show greater activation in the middle frontal gyrus during WM encoding is at odds with literature reporting decreased activation in this region during WM encoding [ ], this previous study showed group differences in performance accuracy which may indicate poor task engagement in patients [ ]. \n\nOur finding that patients showed lower CB1R availability in regions implicated in memory [ ] is consistent with previous work using arterial blood sampling [ ,  ], but is at odds with a study that failed to use arterial blood sampling [ ], necessary for the reliable estimation of the radiotracer kinetics [ ]. Our finding that patients show lower CB1R levels, in the context of functional alterations during WM, is consistent with literature demonstrating that CB1R-deficient mice exhibit WM deficits [ ,  ]. Moreover, our finding that CB1R levels were not associated with behavioural measures of WM is also consistent with literature showing that peripheral CB1R mRNA levels were not associated with WM [ ]. \n\nA recent meta-analysis indicated that central levels of CB1R agonist, anandamide, are elevated in patients with psychotic illnesses [ ]. Moreover, the acute administration of partial CB1R agonist, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, consistently induced WM deficits in healthy volunteers in a systematic review of 35 human studies [ ]. Previous work has also shown that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol induces greater WM deficits in schizophrenia relative to healthy individuals [ ]. While it is unclear if higher levels of endogenous CB1R agonists precipitate CB1R down-regualtion in psychosis, the chronic exposure to CB1R agonists, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, down-regulates CB1R levels in humans. Moreover, CB1R knockout mice, who are deficient in CB1R on GABAergic interneurons, show WM deficits [ ]. \n\n### Strengths and limitations \n  \nA strength of the study was that patients were anti-psychotic naïve/free and satisfied criteria for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, shown to have good diagnostic stability [ ,  ]. A limitation of our study, inherent to all cross-sectional designs, is that we are unable to determine if CB1R alterations are causally implicated in cognitive impairments. Future longitudinal studies using pharmacological interventions, that modulate CB1R availability, are needed to determine whether CB1R agonist-mediated reductions in CB1R availability [ ] induce WM impairments in humans. A limitation of the study was that CB1R availability was only investigated in male volunteers. Given sex differences in CB1R availability [ ] and sex differences in the behavioural and functional effects of cannabinoids on neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity [ ], we specifically investigated the association between CB1R and WM in males to reduce the effect of sex as a source of variability. However, future studies are needed to determine if our findings generalize to female patients. \n\nPET and MRI scans were conducted as closely together as possible. However, due to limited scanner availability, these scans were approximately 1 month apart. Since test−retest data indicates that CB1R availability, as determined by the VT of [ C]MePPEP, remains stable between 1 and 309 days [ ], the delay between the two scans is unlikely to impact the variability of the VT. When restricting the analysis to volunteers who had PET and MRI scans less than 10 days apart, we observed a trend-level association between striatal CB1R availability and mean linear load-dependent BOLD responses in the striatum during memory retrieval. This association is likely to have fallen short of statistical significance (  p   = 0.05) since the sample was statistically underpowered, in accordance with our power calculation. \n\nSince the endocannabinoid system dynamically changes in response to cannabis use [ ], we ensured that all subjects had negative urine drug screens prior to both scans and that subjects with current substance or a history of substance abuse/dependence were excluded. However, future studies should use simultaneous PET-fMRI scanners to improve the integration of multimodal imaging data. \n\nWhile some subjects had previously used cannabis, 1 month of abstinence normalizes CB1R levels [ ] and there were no associations between CB1R levels and prior cannabis use [ ]. Similarly, although tobacco use may influence CB1R levels [ ], there were no group differences in tobacco use or associations between CB1R levels and tobacco use [ ]. \n\nAlthough we were able to disentangle the effects of WM encoding and WM retrieval, WM maintenance was not modelled. Future studies could address this by imposing a longer delay between encoding and retrieval blocks. Although performance was not included in the model, the association between striatal CB1R availability and striatal fMRI BOLD responses remained unchanged when controlling for performance. However, this finding did not survive Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons. Moreover, while patients showed greater frame-wise displacement relative to controls, we controlled for frame-wise displacement in all fMRI analyses and thus, this is unlikely to be a significant confound. \n\nGiven findings indicating that behavioural and functional measures of WM are associated with functional polymorphisms in the cannabinoid 1 receptor (  CNR1  ) gene [ ,  ], a limitation was that we were unable to investigate functional polymorphisms in the   CNR1   gene and how they may be linked to CB1R and WM in schizophrenia. \n\n\n### Implications for understanding the neurobiology of working memory deficits \n  \nOur finding that patients show greater activation during both WM encoding and WM retrieval, in the context of no significant differences in performance, suggests that patients may utilize greater levels of neural activity to achieve levels of performance comparable to controls. \n\nOur findings show that WM encoding and WM retrieval processes are both altered in the early stages of schizophrenia without the confounds of substance use [ ] and anti-psychotic medication [ ]. Moreover, our finding that striatal CB1R availability is associated with altered striatal fMRI activation during WM retrieval in drug-naïve/free FEP patients extends preclinical literature demonstrating that CB1R agonists administered to the striatum impair memory [ ,  ]. Since this association was exclusively shown in patients, but not controls, striatal CB1R dysfunction may precipitate an adaptation in the normal mechanisms underlying WM retrieval in the early stages of psychosis. \n\nOur finding that striatal CB1R availability was associated with striatal activation during WM retrieval may be due to the unique topographical organization of striatal CB1R. CB1R are densely distributed on GABAergic interneurons in the striatum, where they inhibit GABA release [ ,  ], a mechanism known as depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition [ ]. By contrast, CB1R are predominately localized on glutamate neurons in the hippocampus [ ] and pyramidal neurons in the cortex [ ], where they inhibit glutamate release, a mechanism known as depolarization-induced suppression of excitation [ ]. The regional specificity of our findings may therefore indicate that WM impairments in schizophrenia are linked to alterations in the disinhibition of synaptic transmission, arising from striatal CB1R dysfunction on GABAergic interneurons. This adds to other neurochemical evidence implicating the striatum in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [ – ]. \n\nSince CB1R regulate neurotransmitter release by inhibiting N-, P- and Q-type calcium channel openings and by activating inwardly rectifying potassium channels [ ], fewer CB1R may disrupt the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission underlying long-term potentiation [ ,  ]. These findings identify the CB1R as potential target for the treatment of WM impairments in FEP. \n\n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nRelative to controls, drug-naïve/free FEP patients exhibit functional alterations during WM encoding and WM retrieval. In contrast to controls, patients showed a positive association between striatal CB1R availability and mean load-dependent striatal functional activation during WM retrieval. These findings identify altered striatal CB1R availability and striatal neural correlates of WM retrieval in the pathophysiology of WM impairments in FEP. \n\n\n## Supplementary information \n  \n\n\n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"a5c445f2b8206528ad8800ec8020b964"},

The present study examined (1) differences in neural recruitment for escalation and de-escalation decisions of prior investments, and (2) how the activations of these brain networks are affected by two factors that can arguably modulate escalation decisions: (i) self-responsibility, and (ii) framing of the success probabilities. \n\n\n## Results \n  \nImaging data were obtained from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) applied to 29 participants. A whole-brain analysis was conducted to compare brain activations between conditions. ROI analysis, then, was used to examine if these significant activations were modulated by two contextual factors. Finally, mediation analysis was applied to explore how the contextual factors affect escalation decisions through brain activations. The findings showed that (1) escalation decisions are faster than de-escalation decisions, (2) the corresponding network of brain regions recruited for escalation (anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus) decisions differs from this recruited for de-escalation decisions (inferior and superior frontal gyri), (3) the switch from escalation to de-escalation is primarily frontal gyri dependent, and (4) activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus were further increased in escalation decisions, when the outcome probabilities of the follow-up investment were positively framed; and activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions were increased when the outcome probabilities were negatively framed. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nEscalation and de-escalation decisions recruit different brain regions. Framing of possible outcomes as negative leads to escalation decisions through recruitment of the inferior frontal gyrus. Responsibility for decisions affects escalation decisions through recruitment of the superior (inferior) gyrus, when the decision is framed positively (negatively). \n\n \n\n# Body\n \n## Background \n  \nDecision escalation, also called escalation of commitment, refers to a common sunk cost bias in decision making, whereby the decision maker takes into account irrelevant prior information regarding an investment (time, money and/or effort) and consequent emotions, for making future decisions [ ]. Under such circumstances, the mere fact that an investment was made increases the likelihood of further investment, even though it may not be the optimal decision. For example, people may continue investing in a failed project (or stand in a long line at a store), even though the best path forward may be to quit the project (or move to a different line), just because they have already invested in the project (or already spent time standing in one line) [ ]. This decision escalation effect is prevalent, for example, 54% of consumers in one experiment chose a trip based on sunk cost and not its utility [ ]. \n\nThis phenomenon has two characteristics that reflect decision biases deviating from the economic rationality assumption. The first is the decision bias such that action decisions are more consistent with prior choices, even when other information may suggest alternative optimal paths. The second is the violation of the principle of stochastic dominance. When one choice never pays less and can stochastically pay more than a second option, it is stochastically dominant. Two studies have shown that sunk costs can increase the chance of violating this principle when the expected value is low [ ]. Whyte [ ] proposed a gain–loss paradigm to explain decision bias. When the decision frame is negative (i.e., a troubled project), the decision to commit further resources is framed as a choice between losses: a sure loss or a possibility of a larger loss with a chance to return to the reference point. Prospect theory suggests that the decision maker will show risk-taking behavior to avoid a sure loss (i.e., escalation is preferred). Such risk-taking behavior may rely on intuitive processing, rather than on analytical processing. Therefore, some studies have argued that escalation bias can be overcome by deliberate thinking [ ,  ]. Montealegre and Keil [ ] proposed a four-phase de-escalation process that used a systematic procedure for conscious deliberation to make decisions. Based on such insights, it seems that the analytical processing system, slower and more logical, may mediate de-escalation decisions, while the intuitive, gut-feeling-based processing system, faster and more automated, may mediate escalation decisions. \n\nPrior research in sunk costs has reported that the effect exists across different species (such as rats) and is evolutionary [e.g.,  ,  ]. Certain neural mechanisms have been identified to be associated with sunk costs. Specifically, it was found that different networks are sensitive to the sunk cost (already invested) amount, and to the incremental (follow-up) cost needed for saving the initial investment [ ]. The former network includes regions involved in risk-assessment, such as the bilateral medial and superior frontal gyri. The latter includes regions involved in reward processing, including the caudate nucleus, and regions involved in conflict monitoring, such as the cingulate gyrus. Haller and Schwabe [ ] found that reduced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and associated increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), presumably representing deficient integration of emotions into decision processes [ ], is associated with a larger decision escalation bias. Fujino et al. [ ] found that the insula, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are activated during decision escalation. \n\nTogether, these studies demonstrate that decision escalation can be mediated by activity in regions involved in risk aversion states, reward processing, integration of emotions and reflections, self-perception and conflict monitoring [ ,  ,  ]. They also show that different types of decision escalation (e.g., project-continuum paradigm vs. choosing between two alternative sunk costs, see [ ], amounts of sunk cost and required follow-up investment, see [ ], can produce different activation patterns involving different brain regions from the broader abovementioned network of regions. If cognitive processing is to overcome decision-making bias, the neural mechanisms of escalation and de-escalation would be different and may also be affected by different contextual factors. More specifically, we anticipate that brain regions associated with intuitive thinking (system 1) may be more activated when decisions are escalated, while brain regions associated with deliberate thinking (system 2) may be more activated when decisions are de-escalated. \n\nAlthough extant literature has reported certain neural mechanisms associated with sunk costs, there is a key issue that has not been well-studied. That is, what are the neural mechanisms that result in different escalation or de-escalation decisions, and what contextual factors may affect these neural activities? Without such knowledge, it would be difficult to overcome this decision bias. The knowledge has also clinical significance, because decision escalation bias may be accentuated in people with impulse control disorders [ ] including for instance, in gamblers [ ]. \n\nWe hence seek to expand current knowledge of decision escalation, and specifically regarding the brain regions that are recruited for escalation and de-escalation decision. We also investigate the effects of two contextual variables: responsibility and framing conditions. It is important to consider escalation and de-escalation decisions independently, because different brain mechanisms may be involved and can encode rewarding and punishing outcomes differently [ ,  ]. Responsibility and framing are also two common factors that are used to interpret decision escalation from the perspectives of self-justification theory and approach-avoidance theory, respectively [ ,  – ]. \n\nSelf-justification theory argues that when the person who made the prior decision may feel that s/he is responsible for the negative outcome and consequently tend to commit more resource to the troubled prior project in order to rectify past losses and attempt to justify his/her earlier decisions [ ]. Thus, one’s responsibility for a project is highly related to his/her escalation decisions. In addition, approach-avoidance theory argues that when a goal has both positive and negative aspects and conflicts, the stronger of the two will win [ ]. Escalation decisions usually occur when the drive to encourage persistence (i.e. the reward for goal attainment) seems to be greater than the restraint to encourage abandonment (i.e. the punishment for lost) [ ]. Therefore, framing of the expected outcome (called goal framing) aims to focus one’s attention on positive or negative consequence of a decision, which will influence one’s escalation decisions or de-escalation decisions [ ]. Goal framing is different from other types of framing such as risky choice framing and attribute framing, and would have different effects on decision making. See Levin et al. [ ] for details. \n\nScenarios for decision escalation typically include failed prior projects that need further resource investment. The decision maker may choose to save the project (escalate) or to stop it (de-escalate). Here, we extend previous research on decision escalation in two directions. First, we demonstrate differences between brain networks that govern escalation vs. de-escalation decisions. Second, we account for the role of two contextual factors in affecting sunk cost bias: (1) the framing of information regarding the potential outcome as success/the reward for goal attainment or failure/the punishment for goal failure of the follow-up investment (50% chance to succeed/promotion vs. 50% chance to fail/demotion), and (2) responsibility of the decision maker (whether the initial failed decision is made by the decision maker or others). \n\nIn summary, the paradigm of decision escalation is “when decision makers face a prior failed decision and possible outcomes of continuing the project, would they decide to continue or not?” Five theoretical arguments are employed in this research to explain behaviors at different stages of decision escalation and associated neural mechanisms: (1) When decision makers face a failed prior project, their tendency is to escalate the decision in order to revert the situation. This is in line with the arguments of prospect theory and sunk cost effect; (2) When decision makers are responsible for a troubled project, the likelihood of escalation increases based on the self-justification theory. In other words, self-responsibility moderates the sunk cost effect reported in prospect theory; and (3) The likelihood of escalation is affected by the framing of possible outcomes of escalation. The likelihood of escalation is lower in negative framing than in positive framing. In other words, framing moderates the sunk cost effect reported in the prospect theory. This is supported by the approach-avoidance theory and goal-framing effect. Table   shows a summary of these theoretical interpretations and associated hypotheses to be elaborated later.   \nSummary of hypotheses \n  \n\nA 2 × 2 experiment was designed and conducted using the functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) instrument to explore different neural mechanisms involved in escalation and de-escalation, and how contextual scenarios affect neural processes. The scenarios include two steps: (1) a failed project and (2) potential future outcomes. In prior neuroimaging research on decision escalation, responsibility and framing were mostly constant. They can, however, vary between decision situations. It is therefore important to study their roles, and how they affect the recruitment of brain regions for the escalation and de-escalation decisions. The manipulation of future outcomes (positively versus negatively framed) allows the expected gain–loss to come into the experiment. The approach-avoidance theory suggests that decision makers would prefer options of gains (rewards) to those of losses (punishment). The goal framing indicate that the framing of potential future outcomes may affect decision escalation. \n\nBecause negative information from a troubled project may conflict with a decision maker’s existing belief, decisions to escalate failed investments may involve consonance restoration (i.e., trying to ensure that one’s prior decisions, perceptions and future actions are consistent with one another), emotion processing and attempts to save one’s self-image [ ,  – ]. It is reasonable to hypothesize that neural areas associated with consonance restoration and emotional processing such as the ACC, cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus will be higher in escalation decisions (H1). \n\nThe cingulate cortex is involved in conflict monitoring, integration of monetary rewards with motor responses, and connecting emotion and memories [ – ]; the insula mediates interoceptive awareness processes and serves as a repository for negative emotions and events [ – ]; and the precuneus mediates self-perception processes [ ]. All of these processes are expected to be activated when a person decides to risk further investment in order to avoid cognitive dissonance and restore his or her self-image. \n\nIn contrast, when a person decides to cut his or her losses, we posit that decisions become more reflection- and inhibition-dependent. They are consequently likely to involve more momentary risk aversion and the mobilization of inhibition efforts to take the avoidance strategy. We therefore expect that in de-escalation decisions, regions associated with system 2 involved in the inhibition of risky suboptimal choices and learning, namely the inferior and superior frontal gyri [ – ], will be relatively more active (H2). \n\nGiven the central role of responsibility in motivating continued investment in failed projects [ ,  ], we expect that the abovementioned activations in escalation decisions (in the cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus) will be augmented when one’s responsibility is higher compared to when it is lower (H3a). In other words, when one feels more responsible for the failed investment, stronger mental-self considerations are expected [ ] and stronger mobilization of self-image and consonance restoration efforts will be needed. We also expect that when de-escalation decisions are made, low responsibility for past investment should further motivate momentary emphasis on risk aversion. Consequently, inferior and superior frontal gyri are expected to be more activated when the focus that one takes is more on risk aversion than on self- and social-image restoration. We hence anticipate that the expected increased activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions will be stronger under low responsibility compared to high responsibility conditions (H3b). \n\nLastly, the framing of potential outcomes can lead to more approach (avoidance) decisions when the provided information is positively (negatively) framed as gain (loss) [ ,  ]. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the framing of the success probabilities of the follow-up investment can modulate the effects hypothesized in H1 and H2. We expect that when positive framing is used, a stronger tendency toward escalation decisions (“approach”) will form, and an increase in the associated activity in the regions described in H1 (ACC, insula, cingulate gyrus and precuneus) will be observed (H4a). Similarly, we expect that when negative framing is used, a stronger tendency toward de-escalation decisions (“avoidance”) will form, and an increase in the associated activity in the regions described in H2 (frontal gyri) will be observed (H4b). Table   summarizes all hypotheses. \n\n\n## Results \n  \n### Behavioral results \n  \nFor descriptive purposes, we observe that (1) the overall percentage of escalation decisions and de-escalation decisions were 79.6% and 20.4%, respectively. The percentage of escalation decision was significantly higher than the expected mean value of 0.5 (t = 41.82, p = 0.000); and (2) the time for making escalation decisions (  M   = 1.21,   SD   = 0.23) was significantly shorter (  t   = -3.59,   p   = 0.001) than that for de-escalation decisions (  M   = 1.55,   SD   = 0.57). Table   shows the percentage of escalation and the decision time of different scenarios. On average, escalation consumed less decision time than de-escalation. RM-ANOVA revealed that the main effect of framing on escalation decisions was significant (positive framing > negative framing;   F   = 11.612,   p   = 0.002), while the main effect of responsibility was not (  F   = 0.319,   p   = 0.577). The main effects indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in escalation behavior between low and high responsibility alone (main effect), but the potential outcomes framed as gains can lead to more escalation decisions than the potential outcomes framed as losses. Moreover, the interaction effect of these two factors was also significant (  F   = 26.165,   p   = 0.000). This means, responsibility alone does not make significant difference, but framing alone and different combinations of framing and responsibility do make differences. In general, the interaction effect needs further analysis when it is significant.   \nThe percentage of escalation decision and decision time for each decision type \n  \n\nFollow-up t-tests on the interaction effect showed that high responsibility conditions increased escalation decisions only when they were positively framed. Unlike expected, high responsibility made it easier for participants to abort the project under negative framing condition. It was marginally significant. Figure   shows the escalation percentage and decision time under different scenarios. Tables   and   show the result of statistical testing.   \nGraph of interaction effect of responsibility and framing on Escalation decision and decision time \n    \nResults of RM-ANOVA for escalation decisions and decision time \n  \n*  p   < 0.05 \n\n**  p   < 0.01 \n\n***  p   < 0.001 \n    \nResults of paired t-tests for escalation decisions \n  \n p   < 0.10 \n\n*  p   < 0.05 \n\n**  p   < 0.01 \n\n***  p   < 0.001 \n  \n\n\n### FMRI imaging results \n  \nThe objective of the analyses below was to address the following four hypotheses on neural association with decision escalation:  \nH1: activity in the ACC, cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus is higher in escalation decisions. \n\nH2: the inferior and superior frontal gyri are relatively more active in de-escalation decisions. \n\nH3: (a) the abovementioned activations in escalation decisions are augmented in high responsibility conditions, and (b) the abovementioned activations in de-escalation decisions are augmented in low responsibility conditions; and \n\nH4: (a) in positive framing conditions there is stronger activation in the ACC, insula, cingulate gyrus and precuneus; and (b) in negative framing conditions there is stronger activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri. \n \n\nA whole-brain analysis was conducted to find brain regions associated with escalation decisions and de-escalation decisions. It revealed that the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right cingulate cortex, left insula, right medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and right precuneus were more active in escalation decisions (See Fig.  , Panel A and Table  ), while bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), left medial frontal gyrus (MFG), and left superior frontal gyrus (SFG) were more active in de-escalation decisions (See Fig.  , Panel B and Table  ). Therefore, hypotheses 1 and 2 were supported. Both escalation and de-escalation decisions usually involve using analytical processes or intuitive processes to solve the problems under uncertainty or ambiguous situations. Cingulate cortex and insula activated in escalation decisions involve emotional stimuli, while inferior frontal gyrus and superior frontal gyrus activated de-escalation involve cognitive stimuli. Obviously, de-escalation decisions are more likely to be related to rational processing than escalation decisions. The test result of response time in Table   also confirmed this. The decision time for de-escalation decision was longer than that for escalation decision, because rational processing usually need more time to elaborate information.   \n Panel A:   Regions showing greater activation in escalation decisions than in de-escalation decisions [  P   < 0.001, corrected (False Discovery Rate), cluster size > 153, side-bar represents t-statistics].   Panel B:   Regions showing greater activation in de-escalation decisions than in escalation decisions [  P   < 0.001, corrected (False Discovery Rate), cluster size > 212, side-bar represents t-statistics] \n    \nPeak cluster activation for Escalation > De-Escalation and De-Escalation > Escalation contrasts \n  \n\nTo test hypotheses on the effect of responsibility (3a-b) and framing (4a-b), ROI masks were created from the WFU PickAtlas Standard Atlases. The contrast analysis, including [High Responsibility > Low Responsibility], [Low Responsibility > High Responsibility], [Positive Framing > Negative Framing], and [Negative Framing > Positive Framing], were conducted. Results in Tables   and   showed that no significant activations were found in ACC_R, Cingulate Gryus_R, Insula_L and Precuneus_R for [High Responsibility > Low Responsibility] contrast, and in IFG_R, IFG_L, and SFG_L for [Low Responsibility > High Responsibility] contrast. Therefore, H3a and H3b were not supported. This result indicates that responsibility alone does not have significant impact on whether the decision is escalated or not. It is consistent with our behavioral finding that the main effect of responsibility was insignificant. Regarding brain areas associated with framing, positive framing strengthened the activations in ACC_R, insula_L, and precuneus_R, and weakened IFG_L activation. Therefore, H4a and H4b were partially supported when the outcome framing was positive.   \nResults of ROI analyses for brain regions hypothesized to be involved in escalation decisions \n  \n p   < 0.10 \n\n*  p   < 0.05 \n\n**  p   < 0.01 \n\n***  p   < 0.001 \n    \nResults of ROI analyses for brain regions hypothesized to be involved in de-escalation decisions \n  \n p   < 0.10 \n\n*  p   < 0.05 \n\n**  p   < 0.01 \n\n***  p   < 0.001 \n  \n\nBecause H3a-b was not supported, we further examined the interaction effect of responsibility and framing. Additional contrast analyses were conducted, including [High Responsibility × Positive Framing > Low Responsibility × Positive Framing], [High Responsibility × Negative Framing > Low Responsibility × Negative Framing], [Low Responsibility × Positive Framing > High Responsibility × Positive Framing], and [Low Responsibility × Negative Framing > High Responsibility × Negative Framing]. The results in Tables   and   showed that there was no significant activation in brain regions hypothesized to be involved in escalation decisions, but activations of all brain regions hypothesized to be involved in de-escalation decisions (i.e. IFG_L, IFG_R, and SFG_L) were weakened by responsibility when messages were framed positively. Therefore, H3b (the inferior and superior frontal gyri are more activated for de-escalation under the low responsibility scenario) was supported under the positive framing condition.   \nResults of post Hoc analysis for High Self-Responsibility > Low Self-Responsibility in brain regions hypothesized to be involved in Escalation decisions \n    \nResults of post Hoc analysis for Low Self-Responsibility > High Self-Responsibility in brain regions hypothesized to be involved in De-Escalation decisions \n  \n\nIn order to know whether IFG and SFG mediate the effect on escalation decision, we further performed mediation tests. They showed that the IFG mediated the effect of framing on escalation decisions under the responsibility and negative framing conditions; and that SFG activation mediated the effect of responsibility on escalation decisions under positive framing conditions. \n\n\n### Post-Hoc mediation analysis \n  \nMediation models were conducted post-hoc to explore whether the brain activations associated with escalation and de-escalation mediated the relationship between responsibility/framing and escalation decision. As shown in Table  , there was an interaction effect between responsibility and framing on escalation decision. The mediating role of brain activations, then, was examined for each of three significant conditions in Table  . The mediation model included treatment (i.e. responsibility or framing) as the predictor, escalation decision as the dependent variable, brain activations from each of the four escalation ROIs and the two de-escalation ROIs as the mediator. Analyses were run using SPSS macro PROCESS with significance determined by 95% confidence interval (CI) based on 1000 bootstrapped samples. The results showed that only the brain regions associated with de-escalation (i.e. IFG and SFG) play mediating role between responsibility/framing and escalation decision (as shown in Figs.  ,  ,  ). First, the IFG mediated the effect of framing on escalation decision under high responsibility condition. When the responsibility is high, negative messages may increase the activation of IFG, and then inhibited the subjects’ escalation decision (see Fig.  ). As shown in Fig.  , under negative framing condition, the activation of IFG was higher, while the subjects’ escalation decision was lower. Moreover, as the activation of IFG increased, subjects’ escalation decision decreased. This is   why positive messages are more likely to lead to escalation decision than negative messages under high responsibility condition   (As tested in Table  ). In addition, the IFG also mediated the relationship between responsibility and escalation decision under negative framing condition. Responsibility is positively associated with IFG activation, and leads to prohibit the escalation behavior while receiving negative messages (See Fig.  ). As shown in Fig.  , under high responsibility condition, the activation of IFG was higher, while the subjects’ escalation decision was lower. Moreover, as the activation of IFG increased, subjects’ escalation decision decreased. This explains the marginally significant result in Table  . That is,   high responsibility would contribute to de-escalation decision under negative framing condition  . Finally, the SFG played a mediation role in the effect of responsibility on escalation decision under positive framing condition. When the subjects received positive messages,   higher responsibility inhibited SFG activation, which resulted in increased escalation decision   (See Fig.  ). As shown in Fig.  , under high responsibility condition, the activation of SFG was lower, while the subjects’ escalation decision was higher. Moreover, as the activation of SFG decreased, subjects’ escalation decision increased. This finding illustrated the role of SFG in the mechanism of high responsibility on escalation decision under positive framing condition, as shown in Table  .   \nMediation Model under High Responsibility Condition: framing influences escalation decision through IFG under high responsibility condition \n    \nMediation Model under Negative Framing: responsibility influences escalation decision through IFG under negative framing condition \n    \nMediation Model under Positive Framing Condition: responsibility influences escalation decision through SFG under positive framing condition \n  \n\n\n\n## Discussion \n  \nThis study sought to shed light on (1) differences between the neural underpinnings of escalation and de-escalation decisions, and on (2) how these neural processes may be modulated by key contextual/confounding variables. \n\nThe first objective was addressed with H1 and H2. They were supported. The results indicated that escalation decisions engage clusters in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, posterior parts of the cingulate gyrus, precuneus and medial frontal gyrus, as well as a cluster in the left insula. This activation pattern supports the prospect theory perspective that suggests when decision makers face a failed project, they are more likely to avoid losses and choose the risky option (escalation) than maintaining the status quo. That is, escalation decisions require observing the conflict between the choices of accepting the loss and loss recovery (i.e., attempts to overcome past loses, through further or increased investing), and that they are motivated by self-image and interoceptive-awareness [ ,  ] as well as by cognitive consonance restoration [ ]. In contrast, de-escalation decisions engaged clusters in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior and medial frontal gyri that are more consistent with analytical thinking. This activation pattern supports the postulation that de-escalation requires stronger focus on momentary risk aversion and inhibition [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nAn interesting finding from the study is that the neural mechanisms that lead to escalation or termination of a failed project are different. The former involves more intuitive and emotional decision system (system 1), while the latter involves more of the deliberative system (system 2) [ ,  ]. This is also consistent with our behavioral findings that the average time for escalating decisions was shorter than that that for de-escalation. A further question would be whether personality affects individual’s escalation decision. Fujino et al. [ ] reported that individuals who tend to adhere to social rules and regulations are more susceptible to the sunk cost effect. Our findings of high responsibility lead to higher escalation is consistent with their finding of personality, as the tendency to adhere to social rules and regulations is more likely to generate higher perceived responsibility. Another issue worth further investigation is whether the risk attitudes of individuals affects their decision escalation. Theoretically, risk takers are more likely to escalate their decisions. Empirical validation, however, will be necessary. \n\nAdding to this, the behavioral results showed that escalation decisions were made significantly faster compared to de-escalation decisions. This supports the assertion that while de-escalation decisions may be associated with more-reflective-analytical mode, escalation decisions are made in a more intuitive mode that focuses on peripheral (e.g., saving self-image) route (system 1) rather than central route (system 2). This view extends extant neuroimaging works on decision escalation after an initial investment [ ,  ,  ]. \n\nThe second objective of the study was addressed the effect of responsibility and outcome framing with H3a-b and H4a-b, respectively. H3a proposed that activation of the cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus will be further increased in escalation decisions, when responsibility is high. H3b suggested that the increased activation of the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions will be further increased when responsibility is low. Both parts of the hypothesis were not supported. A post-hoc analysis provided partial support for H3b by showing that it may hold true only under positive rather than negative outcome framing conditions. This illuminates the need to account for confounding variables in decision escalation research. These results can be explained by the idea that positive framing is perceived by the decision maker as a potential to gain benefits and hence create additional motivation to escalate the investment, and de-escalation when responsibility was low required additional neural risk aversion and inhibition efforts (i.e., system 2). These efforts are presumed to manifest in increased activation of the frontal gyri. Together, these findings suggest that responsibility, at least in the examined task, is not always confounded in escalation and de-escalation decisions; it becomes relevant only for de-escalation decisions when the success of the follow-up investment is positively framed. \n\nThe mediation models contribute to the big picture by showing that while, as expected, different networks are activated in escalation and de-escalation decisions, the switch between such decisions is primarily dependent on inferior and superior frontal gyri regions, which mediate the integration of contextual information, such as framing and responsibility, into escalation vs. de-escalation decisions. This is in line with the functional role of frontal gyri regions in learning and decision making [ ,  ]. \n\nPrevious works have indicated that IFG plays an important role in executive control and inhibiting inappropriate response [ – ]. This is consistent with our mediation analysis results. More specifically, IFG played a mediating role in the relationship between framing and escalation decisions under high responsibility condition (Fig.  ) as well as the relationship between responsibility and escalation decisions under negative framing condition (Fig.  ). In other words, decision makers may reduce the possibility of choosing the risky escalation behavior through the activation of inhibition control mechanism under high responsibility and negative outcome framing. Positive outcome framing, on the other hand, may induce a decision maker’s belief that the project is more likely to succeed [ ,  ], which leads to higher activation of the intuitive decision mechanism to escalate the decision. \n\nIn summary, the effect of responsibility on escalation reported in previous literature was not supported in our study (the main effect in Table  ). The rationale behind the effect of responsibility is “the greater responsibility one takes, the stronger motivation for rectifying past losses and justifying their earlier decisions would reveal” [ ]. That is, decision makers tend to make the decision in a way that is consistent with the prior decision in order to appear rational in their decisions. Arkes and Blumer [ ] also reported moderate support that personal involvement increases the sunk cost effect. Our findings do not fully support the argument. Nonetheless, we found that stronger sunk cost effect that leads to escalation decisions when high responsibility and positive outcome expectation are present. The percentage of escalation increases from 74.2% in negative framing to 98.4% in positive framing (see Fig.  ). This conditional finding of responsibility adds new insight into this aspect. \n\nThe effect of outcome framing on escalation decision can be explained from the approach-avoidance theory [ ]. That is, positive framing provides information of possible gains that decision makers would pursue while negative framing informs possible loss that decision makers tend to avoid. The positive framing focuses attention on the expected gains that makes it easier to self-justify a commitment of more resources (approach) and hence encourages a decision maker to take risks associated with escalation, while the negative framing leads to the other way around (avoidance). \n\nIn our study, we found that activation of the cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus increased in escalation decisions (H4a), when the success probabilities of the follow-up investment are positively framed; activation of the inferior and superior frontal gyri increased in de-escalation decisions, when the success probabilities of the follow-up investment are negatively framed (H4b). H4a indicates that brain regions typically associated with system 1 (e.g., ACC and insula) and the midline structure associated with “self” (e.g., precuneus and medial FG) are more activated when decisions are escalated. H4b indicates that brain regions associated with system 2 (e.g., IFG and SFG) are more activated while decisions are de-escalated. The findings support the asymmetry effect of gain–loss, but the activated brain areas are different from those reported in Jessup and O’Doherty [ ] whose study reports that brain regions including lateral orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insular cortex, and ACC show an increase in activities to both rewarding and punishing events, while medial frontal cortex and part of ventral striatum responded selectively to the rewarding but not punishing outcomes. This may be due to different experimental settings and also implies that more research is needed. To summarize,   our findings on outcome framing are an important contextual extension of prior research on decision escalation   [ ,  ,  ]. We show here that not only framing influences escalation and de-escalation decisions when facing sunk costs, but also expands the separation between the neural activations of brain networks involved in escalation versus de-escalation decisions. \n\nDecision biases occur when objectively equivalent probability is presented as either positive framing or negative framing. As shown in Table  , negatively framed messages have a lower frequency of escalation biases than positively framed messages under high responsibility condition. In addition, the mediation model showed that negative framing increased IFG activation and further contributed to de-escalation decision. From a practical standpoint, our findings suggest that   decision escalation bias can be alleviated by using more negatively framed success probabilities of follow-up investments, especially under high responsibility condition.   For example, if a person wants to avoid exceeding his or her gambling limit, he or she should think about the probabilities of losing rather than winning the next bet. Similarly, managers should focus on project failure probabilities rather than on success probabilities in order to reduce the risk of being biased by sunk costs. The efficacy of such approaches, though, requires further research. The neural findings further shed light on the brain underpinnings of the shift from image saving to risk aversion focus. This suggests that people with deficits in the abovementioned brain networks may be more (or less) susceptible for decision escalation bias. While some evidence for such effects exists (e.g., it has been shown that gamblers differ from non-gamblers in their follow-up responses to wins and losses, see [ ], future research should more closely examine how deficits in any of the brain regions examined here can affect escalation decisions. Future research may also examine the effects of therapies on sunk cost decisions of patients. For example, the ACC tends to be hyper-active in major depressive disorder and in bi-polar disorder subjects; and pharmacological and brain stimulation treatments can reduce ACC activity [ ]. The implications of such treatments for decision making in response to sunk costs are unknown, and should be examined. \n\nAnother way to attenuate escalation behavior is to decrease the responsibility of decision makers, so as to reduce their discomfort and moderate their tendency to affirm the correctness of their original belief [ ,  ]. Low responsibility may help decision makers control and regulate uncomfortable feeling in the pursuit of better results. The result from our mediation analysis (Fig.  ) supports the argument as superior frontal gyrus (SFG) played a mediating role. SFC is a brain area generally believe to correlate with cognitive control, negative feeling regulation, and risk aversion [ – ]. Lower responsibility of a decision maker may lead to avoiding risky behavior by more activation of SFG. \n\n\n## Limitations \n  \nSeveral limitations of this study are noteworthy. First, the task had fixed success of follow-up investment probabilities, it belonged to the investment-continuum paradigm, and it did not vary the prior investment and follow up costs. Hence, the generalizability of our findings should be extended, by for example, replicating the study while using different decision scenarios, different success probabilities, and different levels of prior and needed investments. Second, the responsibility manipulation did not produce strong neural effects. Different tasks and manipulations may be developed in future research to better elicit such effects. Third, some potential confounding factors such as the forced choice in the experiment and project size (million dollars vs. billion dollars) can be accounted for in future research. Fourth, the decision was targeted at a single decision stage and did not explore the complexity of multi-stage situations; this is a fruitful area for expansion. In addition, we focused on one biasing aspect of sunk cost, and did not delve into nuanced biases, such as the ability of sunk cost to drive violations of the stochastic dominance principle [ ]. This also represents an important area for future research. Moreover, inferring value assessment from brain imaging data is difficult [ ]. Future studies can use additional experiments to more directly relate value judgments to sunk cost situations. Lastly, this study did not consider attributes of the decision makers, such as personality (especially agreeableness and conscientiousness, see Fujino et al. [ ], experience and age of the subjects. Future research may extend our findings by integrating more covariates and predictors into the model. \n\n\n## Conclusions \n  \nEscalation of commitment to a failed project is a common decision bias. The goal of this study was to identify neural correlates associated with the escalation and de-escalation decision and the effect of responsibility and outcome framing. The findings showed that (1) escalation decisions are faster than de-escalation decisions, (2) the corresponding network of brain regions recruited for escalation (anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus) decisions differs from this recruited for de-escalation decisions (inferior and superior frontal gyri), (3) the switch from escalation to de-escalation is primarily frontal gyri dependent, and (4) activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula and precuneus were further increased in escalation decisions, when the outcome probabilities of the follow-up investment were positively framed; and activation in the inferior and superior frontal gyri in de-escalation decisions were increased when the outcome probabilities were negatively framed. The findings shed new insight and contribute toward a better understanding of the mechanism underneath the decision escalation. \n\n\n## Methods \n  \n### Study design and procedures \n  \nA 2 × 2 (responsibility x outcome framing) within-subject factorial design was employed. Responsibility was manipulated by presenting four software projects (see Table  ) in which participants were asked to make an initial project decision regarding the development approach (High responsibility condition) and four other projects presented as having the development approach decided by others in the organization (Low responsibility condition), see Fig.   for a sample. In addition, the success or failure of the project would be related to the participants under high responsibility condition (decision scenarios presented as “If the project fails, it means you are incapable.”, see Table  ), but not related to the participants under low responsibility (decision scenarios presented as “If the project fails, it doesn’t mean you are incapable.”). Framing was manipulated by presenting decision scenarios with foci on either probabilities of success (Positive framing: “Increasing budget will have a half chance of succeeding with the project\") or probabilities of failure (Negative framing: “Increasing budget will have a half chance of failing with the project\"). The probability of success and failure was 50%.   \nThe Projects used in the experiment \n    \nProcedure of the Experiment. Designated experimental scenarios were presented to subjects for their decision. High responsibility indicated asked the subject to commit to a choice, while the low responsibility indicated that the decision was done by others \n    \nThe decision scenarios used in the experiment \n  \n\n\n### Participants \n  \nTwenty-nine participants were recruited with the requirement that they need to have taken at least one Information Systems [IS] course in their college education, 13 females; age range 21–33,   M   = 23.6). All were healthy, right-handed, experiment naïve, and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They had no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders or contraindications to MRI. The experiment was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of National Taiwan University. All participants provided written informed consent and were paid about US$20 for their time. \n\nParticipants were asked to take the role of an Information System [IS] manager of a company, in which they are responsible for managing eight software projects that cost a lot of money and need more money to avoid failure. The original investment was sunk cost. It could not be recovered. For each project, they were given 14 decision scenarios in which the projects were in trouble. They had to decide whether to escalate (invest more to save the project) or de-escalate (stop the project). \n\n\n### MRI procedure \n  \nBefore the MRI scanning, participants were given 10 min for reading the descriptions of all eight project scenarios. Then, they were screened for physical and psychiatric disorders. No exclusions were made. Scanning commenced with structural acquisition for anatomic normalization (10 min). Functional scans were acquired from four sessions. In each session, two software projects were randomly assigned (one with high self-responsibility and another with low). Participants were given 20 s to review the description of each software project scenario. In the high self-responsibility condition they were asked to make an initial decision. Next, they performed 14 trials of project decisions in the different manipulated conditions. In each trial, participants were given a decision message for 6 s, followed by a decision response (continuing the project or not) for 4 s. For controlling the clicking movement, the ratio of “continue button” on the left side and the right side was counterbalanced. Each participant performed a total of 112 trials. The experimental paradigm is shown in Fig.  .   \nExperimental Paradigm. The problem for requesting an increase of financial commitment was presented to the subject and then ask for the subject to decide whether to stop the project \n  \n\n\n \n","utf8_text_md5_checksum":"04ccf753ecd8138b8f2511170359b465"}
